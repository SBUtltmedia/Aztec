# Theyr (Twine Multiplayer Package)
Theyr provides a development environment that allows anyone to create multiplayer <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a> applications using the <a href="http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/">SugarCube</a> story format.

How to install


You'll need nodejs
rename the file "rename this file to config.json" to "config.json"

run:
npm install
npm start

To make a public version you will need a server capable of hosting node, we are using Heroku, which used to be free when we started the project 
but is now a paid service.
