drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Character assignment and points selection":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t                        You open your eyes and find yourself staring out a window at the night sky. The noise you heard was the distant rumble of thunder.<br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are Xicotencatl the Elder, the wizened leader of the Tlaxcalan confederation. You have long held power, but you know your days will soon come to an end and you fear what may come to pass in your absence. <br> <br> You lie on your mat upon the floor listening to the thunder, unsettled by a very clear sense that something is about to happen. For now, you have no choice but to wait for the Gods to reveal their plan. In the meantime, you must complete a small task.<br> <br>  Use the counter below to develop your character.

They have been giving gifts to people of the coast and winning their affection. These coastal people are allied to the Mexica, but have been brutalized by them. Like so many others in the empire, they harbor deep resentment for their Aztec overlords.<br> <br> Rumor has it that the strangers have been warned about the Mexica, but show little fear. They have asked many questions about the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán and how they might reach it.<br> <br> Go to the Tlaxcalan discussion board and discuss amongst yourselves how you feel about this news.<br> <br>  You may:<br> <br> 1. <a data-passage=\"Tlaxcalans wait\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">Do nothing</a>.<br> <br> 2.

It seems a delegation of Mexica went in search of the strangers who arrived by sea and warned them not to make the journey to Tennochtitlán. The Mexica plied the strange men with gifts, laying at their feet a small mountain of treasures, from coveted cotton cloth to the finest quetzal plumes. The foreigners appeared very impressed, but paid little heed to the Mexica's warnings. They have requested a meeting with the Emperor Moctezuma.
