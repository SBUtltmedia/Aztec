The boom you heard was the sound of cannon fire and you startle as another shot tears through the sky. <br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are Hernán Cortés: Spaniard, soldier, and adventurer, off to seek your fortune in a foreign land. The ship upon which you stand is one of 11 under your command and you have just set sail from Cuba against the wishes of the island's Governor, Diego Velazquez. You have just embarked on what may just be your greatest adventure yet and you are eager to escape the clutches of the governor.

You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Cortes sets sail from Cuba":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">    You must wait for enough players to gather to begin.<br> <br> 1 Spanish players have joined the game.

He tells you that a pair of messengers have arrived from the coast, bearing beautiful gifts. A group of strangers have come who desire your release and they have paid him handsomely. Your master informs you that you are free and hands you a letter. It reads: <br> <br> “Gentlemen and brothers, here in Cozumel I have learnt that you are captives in the hands of a Cacique, and I pray you that you come here to Cozumel at once, and for this purpose I have sent a ship with soldiers, in case you have need of them, and a ransom to be paid to those Indians with whom you are living.

When the residents of Tenochtitlán threw water upon the fire, it only grew stronger.<br> <br> Third, lightning struck the Temple of Xiuhteuctli, despite the fact that it was barely raining.<br> <br> Fourth, a comet fell from the sky in the middle of the day. The comet had three tails and where they were seen, they made a great noise, like the sound of rattles.<br> <br> Fifth, the waters of Lake Texcoco set fire, boiling and bubbling, destroying houses along the shore.<br> <br> Sixth, at night, a woman could  be heard crying out, “O my children, we are about to go forever.” “O my children, where am I to take you?”<br> <br> Seventh, the residents of Lake Texcoco caught a strange bird, like a crane. Its skull was deformed and reflected the stars, like a mirror.

At sea behind them is the biggest canoe you have ever seen. They speak to each other in a strange language, but their message is given to you by a woman who speaks your own tongue. They ask who you are and from whence you came. You tell the strangers that you come from Mexico and you have been sent by the great Moctezuma. <br> <br> Having decided not to deliver Moctezuma's gifts, you simply deliver his message, advising the strangers not to make the journey inland. It is known that they want to meet your leader in person, but such a meeting is not necessary, you tell them. The road is long and dangerous. The strangers refuse your warning, however, and ask you to deliver their request to Moctezuma. They present you with gifts of beads and fine cloth to take back upon your return. <br> <br> Go to the main discussion board and get to know these strange men. What might you want to ask them, given how much you've heard about them? In addition to getting to know each other on the main discussion board, you may want to talk and strategize within your faction.<br> <br>  You stand awkwardly on the beach, wondering what lies ahead.<br> <br> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\"><br> <br> You are waiting for the Tlaxcalan team to make a decision.<br> <br>  </span>","The Spaniards Head Inland":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  You've been watching the events of the last few weeks closely, wondering what all this might mean for you.

They remind you that it's not only the Spaniards you have left at the mercy of the Aztecs. They demand that you stay and fight. <br> <br> They have you surrounded and you find yourselves with little choice.

As you look at the faces of the strangers in your midst you cannot help but wonder what this visit has in store for you.<br> <br>  It is your first time in this great city, which you hope to explore to its fullest. You are not surprised when Moctezuma separates you from the Spaniards. As he escorts them to their quarters, you are placed in the care of an Aztec pochteca, who leads you to your own quarters on the other side of the city.<br><br> Your lodgings are sparse, but you have what you need. The pochteca allows you time to settle in before he offers to escort you to the market. You have heard many things about the great market at Tlatelolco but have never before been able to visit. You happily accept his offer and <a data-passage=\"Tlaxcalans Visit Tlatelolco\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">wonder what you will find</a>. <br><br> </span>","Tlaxcalans Visit Tlatelolco":"   \t \t        \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t           With the pochteca as your guide, you set out across the city. You are eager to visit the legendary Tlatelolco Market and to be the first Tlaxcalans ever to lay eyes upon its fabled riches. You are halfway to your destination when you are approached by a messenger. He has come to assign you a task.<br> <br> The messenger informs you that the Spaniards have decided to create a guide to the city that will provide useful advice to future explorers. Given the importance of Tlatelolco Market, it must occupy a central place in the guide. However, the Spaniards worry that they will be unfamiliar with many of the riches to be found there and that their description may not do it justice. They would like to enlist your help.<br> <br> Your first task is to go to your game documents and read Bernal Diaz' account of Tenochtitlán, where you will find a detailed description of the Tlatelolco Market. When you have finished reading, choose one team member to start a new page on their site titled “Tlatelolco Market: Insider's Guide.” You must work together to create a special entry for the Spanish guidebook.<br> <br> Like any good insider's guide, your entry should include:<br> <br> An introduction that describes the specific location<br> An account of which sights live up to the hype and which ones do not<br> The best bargains to be found<br> Instructions on where to eat like a local and how to avoid tourist traps<br> <br> Pay attention to detail, because there are points at stake here!<br> <br> As compensation for this work, however, the Spaniards have decided to include you in their dinner invitation at Moctezuma's Palace tonight, where there will be a spectacular feast!<br> <br> But first, you must complete your task.

The Tlaxcalans appear annoyed at this suggestion, though they remain quiet.<br> <br> Your Aztec hosts grant your request and, in exchange, offer you a copy of a cookbook. It seems they have chosen to commemorate this event by recording tonight's recipes. You breathe a sigh of relief as Marina begins translating the recipes.

As you prepare to set out on your tour, you discuss this among yourselves and decide it would be in everyone's best interest to create a guide to the city.

The residents of the city recovered quickly from their horror and chased down the Spaniards, who retreated from the plaza and barricaded themselves in the palace. They were not alone in the palace, however, for Moctezuma had taken shelter there too. In a shocking move, the Spaniards were able to take him prisoner! To think, the all-powerful Mexica emperor is now nothing more than a captive to the invaders!<br>  <br> This was the situation when Cortés and his newly-fortified army returned to the city.

It's clear that the people of Tenochtitlán are wary of their presence. Nonetheless, life must go on. Moctezuma has granted permission for an elaborate celebration to be held, the festival of Toxcatl, which will honor the God Huitzilopochtli. For days now, the city has been bustling with energy as everyone prepares.<br> <br> The festival will begin today and the final preparation last night was the installation of an elaborate sculpture of Huitzilopochtli in front of the Templo Mayor. The sculpture is moulded from the ground seeds of the chicolote, a medicinal plant, and adorned in the finest of feathers. You gaze proudly upon this magnificent tribute to your God. You look on as a parade of warriors pass in single file before him, making offerings of food. <br> <br> The drums begin to sound and the greatest warriors in the Aztec Empire start to dance. You watch, mesmerized. As the music reaches a fever pitch, chaos unfolds around you. The Spaniards are attacking the warriors, who have been caught off guard! They cut down the bulk of the mighty Aztec Army in a single blow.<br> <br> As the dust settles, people flood into the plaza.

You have 4 choices:<br> <br> <b>Option 1:</b> Aid the Spaniards and lay siege to the Aztec capital.

Though your hatred of the Mexica runs deep, the Spaniards are not to be trusted. If you join forces with your historical enemies, the foreigners won't stand a chance. You will promise support and then send word to the Mexica, laying a trap that the Spaniards cannot possibly escape <a data-passage=\"Tlaxcala Sides with the Aztecs\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">Spaniards cannot possibly escape</a>. <br> <br> When you have agreed on the best course of action, input your decision here.

Feathers sticky with blood cling to his bones and he bears the stench of death. You thought this whole adventure was just a dream, but the god of the Aztec underworld now stands before you. You briefly wonder if you are still dreaming, but when a drop of blood falls on your hand, the feeling is all too real. You know you are awake.<br> <br> As Mictlantecuhtli begins to speak, smoke spills from his open mouth. “Human, you have come to my lair uninvited one too many times. Every time I want to nap, I find you in my chair. Robbed of sleep, I have completed all your assignments for you in the hope that you would go away and never come back. And yet, here you are. Again.

For weeks, the people of Tenochtitlán have been preparing for a battle like nothing the city has ever seen before. You are confident in your advantage over the foreigners, given your knowledge of the city streets and your access to vital resources. Your enemies have been weakened over the past weeks, as the people of the city have denied them food.<br> <br> As the members of the council weigh the options before you, a messenger enters the chamber with a surprising announcement. The Spaniards would like to make an exchange: they will release Moctezuma on the condition that they be allowed to leave the city unharmed. Does your former leader's life still have value to you? Or would you rather have vengeance on your enemies?<br> <br> Go to the Aztec discussion board and consider their offer. You may want to consult with the Spaniards before you make your decision.<br> <br> Option 1: Accept the Spaniard's offer, welcome Moctezuma back, and allow the Spaniards to leave peacefully.<br> <br> Option 2: Refuse the deal. Moctezuma has proven an ineffective leader, and these Spaniards must be dealt with once and for all. <br> <br> When you have made your choice, Tlacaelel must enter your decision.

You will propose an alliance with the Mexica-a risky move, but one that you hope will pay off!<br> <br> You tell your guests that they must fight their battle alone and send them on their way.

Along the way, you prepare your allies for what you might encounter. Your Tlaxcalan friends listen closely and you can't help but wonder at their allegiance. As you prepare to face Velazquez' forces, you are completely at the mercy of your native allies. You do everything in your power to win them over, but is it enough?<br> <br>  You fall into a troubled sleep, wondering what the next morning will bring.<br> <br> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\"><br> <br> You are waiting for the Tlaxcalans to do something.<br> <br> </span>","Tlaxcalans leave Cortes to fend for himself":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> You have received word that the enemy camp lies just ahead.

You decide that the best course of action is not to confront the enemy head on, but to take them by surprise in a sneak attack. <br> <br> You wait until midnight to launch your attack, hoping to catch the enemy forces asleep. You give the command to attack and charge the Spanish camp, but you are missing some of your men! As the enemy forces collect themselves and gather their weapons to fight back, you realize that none of your Tlaxcalan allies are with you. Have you been betrayed? <br> <br> You don't have long to dwell on this fact, for the battle quickly turns against you. You fight for your life, but to no avail.

You join your compatriots in an effort to calm the crowd, telling them to retreat to their homes and save their fight for another day.<br> <br>  As the mob retreats and quiet returns to the city, you watch the Spaniards lead Moctezuma back inside the palace and wonder what lies ahead for your once-powerful leader.<br> <br> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\"><br> <br> You are waiting for Aguilar to do something.<br> <br>   </span>","Spaniards Kill Aztec Leader":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> You have decided that the risk of keeping Moctezuma alive outweighs the benefit and have sent him to meet his Gods. <br> <br> You send a messenger to the roof of the palace to inform the residents of Tenochtitlán that their leader is dead. Though you feared a riot, the city remains strangely calm.

You can't believe you escaped with your life! Many others were not so lucky-a fact that becomes starkly clear as you take stock of the men who now walk beside you. <br> <br> When you feel you have reached a safe distance, Aguilar calls out to your compatriots to stop and recommend they rest a while. As the ragged soldiers settle in and create a makeshift camp with what little supplies they have, you gather your most trusted counselors to weigh your options. <br> <br> Given the conflict with Velazquez back in Cuba and the condition of your ships, escape from the mainland is not an option. Besides, you have witnessed the riches of this land and could never walk away from so great a reward. You inform your men that there is no choice but to lay siege to the city. But will you go it alone or will you return to Tlaxcala and attempt to rebuild your army? If you choose the former, you have no safe place to regroup and will have to launch your attack quickly. You have suffered enormous damages in your escape from the city, but you would  have the element of surprise to strengthen your hand. To succeed at the latter, however, will require the support of the Tlaxcalan people. Do you think you have it?<br> <br> Go to the Spanish discussion board and consider your options.

The last time you saw your friends, they left with Cortes to confront Velazquez' men on the coast... and never came back. Though you wonder if they are to be trusted, you have few other options at this point and even fewer friends. <br> <br> Much to your relief, your hosts welcome you with open arms and treat you to a hearty meal. As you gratefully fill your belly, you address the question on everyone's minds: what happened to Cortes? It seems the fate of your former leader will remain a mystery, however. The Tlaxcalan leaders report that they left Cortes and the rest of the contingent as they passed Tlaxcala, taking the opportunity to return home. That was the last they ever saw of him.<br> <br> You then recount the events of the past weeks, but it seems your friends have kept up with the news out of Tenochtitlán and they already know what transpired in the city. All that remains, then, is to make your case. You inform the Tlaxcalan leaders of your plan: you will regroup, consolidate your forces over the coming months, and prepare to lay siege to Tenochtitlán. <a data-passage=\"Tlaxcalans Decide About the Spaniards\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">Will they join you</a>?<br> <br> </span>","Tlaxcalans Decide About the Spaniards":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\"> <br> You are waiting for Xicotencatl_Elder to make a decision.<br> <br> </span>","Tlaxcala Does Nothing":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> You have made your case to the Tlaxcalans.

Perhaps their decision is not as easy as you had hoped. <br> <br> When they finally inform you of their decision, you cannot conceal your disappointment. They have refused your request. They will not fight on your behalf and send you to face the Mexica alone. <br> <br> As you head back into the mountains, you wonder if you <a data-passage=\"Tlaxcala Does Nothing Spaniards Fight Aztecs Alone\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">stand a chance without your indigenous allies at your side</a>. <br> <br> </span>","Tlaxcala Does Nothing Spaniards Fight Aztecs Alone":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  You leave Tlaxcala disappointed and unsure of the future.
