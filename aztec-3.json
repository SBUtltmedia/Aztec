Library":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>        <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">It's eight weeks into the semester and you're already drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Character assignment and points selection":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t                        You open your eyes and find yourself staring out a window at the night sky. The noise you heard was the distant rumble of thunder.<br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are Maxixcatl, a lesser king of the Tlaxcalan confederation. For years, you have bowed to the will of Xicotencatl the Elder, but as the aged ruler nears his end, you wait for your opportunity to claim power for yourself.<br> <br> You lie on your mat upon the floor listening to the thunder, unsettled by a very clear sense that something is about to happen. For now, you have no choice but to wait for the Gods to reveal their plan. In the meantime, you must complete a small task.<br> <br> Use the counter below to develop your character. You have 20 points, which you may distribute however you choose between qualities: strength, loyalty, and wisdom. These qualities will be important in the days to come, so choose wisely. <br> <br>   <div id=\"statsPicker\"></div><br>  <br> <div class=\"show\"><br> You need to assign points to your character to continue. <br> </div> <div class=\"hide\">   Are you ready to <a data-passage=\"Quest intro: The Tlaxcalan Legend of Quetzalcoatl\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">begin your journey</a>?<br>  <br>   </div>"},"Quest_Points_A":12,"Quest_Points_T":8,"gifts":"Yes","Moc_Mut_Vote":0}
