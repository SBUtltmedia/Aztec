macro-live-block\">It's eight weeks into the semester and you're already drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Character assignment and points selection":"         \t<div class=\"error-view\"><button class=\"error-toggle\" type=\"button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Toggle the error view\" title=\"Toggle the error view\"></button><span class=\"error\">Error: &lt;&lt;run&gt;&gt;: bad evaluation: Window.SugarCubeState.variables.users[role] is undefined</span><pre class=\"error-source\" aria-hidden=\"true\" hidden=\"hidden\"><code>&lt;&lt;run showStats()&gt;&gt;</code></pre></div> \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t         You open your eyes and find yourself on a ship. The boom you heard was the sound of cannon fire and you startle as another shot tears through the sky.<br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are Cristóbal de Olid: Spaniard, soldier, and adventurer, off to seek your fortune in a foreign land. The ship upon which you stand is one of 11 under the command of Hernán Cortés, who has set sail from Cuba against the wishes of the island's Governor (and your good friend), Diego Velazquez. Cortés has convinced you to join him on what may just be your greatest adventure yet and you are eager to escape the clutches of the governor.

You must travel there to claim the heart and secure his blessing. Your journey will be long and difficult, however, and you will need many resources to sustain you if you are to succeed. Collecting these resources is the key to victory. Because the Pochteca is a trader, he knows the terrain well. It is up to him to lead your team in this quest.<br> <br> Do not hesitate in this journey, for you are not the only ones seeking this treasure. Your sworn enemies, the Tlaxcalans, have fought valiantly against you for many years and have resisted conquest. They would deny you the blessing of Quetzalcoatl to claim it for themselves, a feat which would surely fuel their warriors and steel them in their struggle against you.<br> <br> When you have read the following instructions and are ready to begin your quest, click the link below to enter the palace. <br> <br> In the palace you will find 6 place glyphs. Each of these glyphs represents a site of great significance in Central Mexico and in each you will find a vital resource for your journey. In order to collect each resource, you must work with your team to identify the correct name that corresponds with the glyph. Click on each glyph to visit that place and receive a clue to its location. You will need to draw on all your knowledge to solve each puzzle! Once you have figured out where you are, the Pochteca will enter the name into a text box that is only available on his screen. When he enters the correct response, your team will collect the resource located there and you will not be able to return.<br> <br> When you have obtained enough resources to survive your journey, you will be allowed to travel to Cholula. Because the Aztecs have further to travel, they must gather 5 goods, while the Tlaxcalans only require 4. <br> <br> Enter the palace and <a data-passage=\"Scavenger Hunt Hub\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">begin your quest</a>.<br> <br> </span>","2 Return to the Library":"         \t<div class=\"error-view\"><button class=\"error-toggle\" type=\"button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Toggle the error view\" title=\"Toggle the error view\"></button><span class=\"error\">Error: &lt;&lt;run&gt;&gt;: bad evaluation: Window.SugarCubeState.variables.users[role] is undefined</span><pre class=\"error-source\" aria-hidden=\"true\" hidden=\"hidden\"><code>&lt;&lt;run showStats()&gt;&gt;</code></pre></div> \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> A week has passed and every day you've gone back to the library after class, looking for the mysterious room. You've explored every inch of the building, growing increasingly desperate with every day that goes by. Every night you've lain awake for hours, trying to figure out what happened and whether you just imagined the whole thing. You wonder if you're losing your mind, because it sure feels like it.<br> <br> Your history teacher didn't help the situation when she handed back your assignment today. It turns out you really did write it. And you got an A. You now have another assignment due next week and you're extra stressed because now the bar is way too high! Your teacher is going to expect A-level work from you every time and you're just not sure it's in you.<br> <br> It's the end of the day and you know you should go home and get to work on this new assignment, but you just can't stop yourself from going back to the library. It's become an obsession. Just like every other day for the last week, you start on the top floor in the back corner. You brace yourself for the worst, knowing that you won't find what you were looking for, but there it is! You can barely believe your eyes. <br> <br> You carefully reach for the door knob, afraid that it will disappear before you can grasp it. But it doesn't! You turn the handle, give the door a good pull, and it opens to reveal the room exactly as you remember it: books piled high, overstuffed chair, one small table. How is this even happening? This can't be real...can it?<br> <br>   You make your way to the chair and you hear the door swing shut behind you. You sink down into the cushions and close your eyes, confused and relieved all at the same time.

It is known that they want to meet your leader in person, but such a meeting is not necessary, you tell them. The road is long and dangerous. The strangers refuse your warning, however, and ask you to deliver their request to Moctezuma.

Surely their countrymen will want to see these sights later on! They all agree that it would be good to help future adventurers make the most of their visit, but it's clear that they also want to establish their own authority and newfound expertise.<br> <br> Your first task is to go to your game documents and read Bernal Diaz' account of Tenochtitlán, where you will find a description of each of the five sites above. When you have finished reading, go to your site and start a new page titled “Lonely Planet Guide: Tenochtitlán.” Each Spanish player will be responsible for writing the entry for one stop on the itinerary above. Marina, you have been tasked with writing the introduction. <br> <br> Like any good guide book, your introduction should include:<br> <br> A broad overview of the city, with its most important highlights<br> Any historical background that might be of interest to travelers<br> Instructions for how to get there<br> Suggestions for what to eat… and what not to eat... during your stay<br> <br> Pay attention to detail, because there are points at stake here!<br> <br> Once your guidebook entry is complete, paste a link here to share with the other players. Make sure you've set it so that everyone with the link can read it. <br> <br> Your entry is:  <input id=\"textbox-ma-tg\" name=\"textbox-ma-tg\" type=\"text\" inputmode=\"text\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"macro-textbox\"><br> <br>  When your contribution to the guidebook is ready, you may continue <a data-passage=\"Everyone Gathers for a Feast\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">on to the feast</a>!<br> <br>","New Aztec Leader":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> After much angry debate in the Council Room, you finally determine that Moctezuma has the greatest loyalty of his men, and you <a data-passage=\"Set up for the Feast\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">move forward under his leadership</a> </span>","Set up for the Feast":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t        While your guests are off exploring the city, it's time to prepare for the greatest feast this city has ever seen! <br> <br>  Moctezuma has decided to spare no expense! These strangers, both Spanish and Tlaxcalan, will enjoy the greatest meal of their life. They will not be able to deny the wealth of the Aztec Empire! If this event is to go down in history as the greatest feast the world has ever seen, there must be a record. Moctezuma has commissioned a cookbook to commemorate the event. He orders all of his closest advisors to assist in this task. Each member of your team will create a recipe to include in your cookbook. To demonstrate his culinary greatness, Moctezuma will contribute a recipe of his own.<br> <br> Your first task is to go to your game documents and read Bernal Diaz' account of the Aztec feast. When you are done, go to your site and start a new page titled “Aztec Cookbook.” Here, you must create a recipe using only ingredients that we know were accessible to the Aztecs. You may provide a detailed recipe of a dish described by Diaz or you may use his account as inspiration for a dish or your own creation. Either way, be careful to source local ingredients, because there are points at stake here!<br> <br> Once your recipe is complete, paste a link here to share with the other players. Make sure you've set it so that everyone with the link can read it. <br> <br>  Your recipe is:  <input id=\"textbox-tlc-rec\" name=\"textbox-tlc-rec\" type=\"text\" inputmode=\"text\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"macro-textbox\"><br> <br>   When your contribution to the cookbook is ready, you may continue <a data-passage=\"Everyone Gathers for a Feast\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">on to the feast</a>!","Judging the Feast Documents":"   \t \t        \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  Here you will find links to each recipe in the Aztec cookbook. You must read each recipe and judge them for accuracy. Have they properly sourced their ingredients or are there items here that can't be found in Tenochtitlán?  <br> <br> To aid you in this task, you may want to revisit Bernal Diaz' account of Tenochtitlán. You may also want to read his account of the Aztec feast, visit the Codex Mendoza, and review other course materials. When you have read each entry, you must decide whether it is accurate and assign it a grade of pass or fail.<br> <br> As you evaluate their work, they are also evaluating yours.

As you approach the first break in the causeway, your men put down the portable bridge and you are able to cross, but others are not so lucky. The bridge collapses under the weight of so many men and you carry bits of wood in a feeble attempt to cross the next break in the causeway.

You agree that this is the best chance for success and wait patiently for nightfall.<br> <br> At midnight, Cortes makes the signal to attack, hoping to catch the enemy forces asleep. Rather than spring into action, you make your retreat. This is not your battle to fight and Cortes is not your friend.

It seems things have grown increasingly tense in the capital since you left the city with Cortés.<br> <br>  It all began with a massacre. While you were away at the coast, the remaining Spaniards cut down the Mexica's most powerful warriors in the middle of a religious festival! The residents of the city recovered quickly from their horror and chased down the Spaniards, who retreated from the plaza and barricaded themselves in the palace. They were not alone in the palace, however, for Moctezuma had taken shelter there too. In a shocking move, the Spaniards were able to take him prisoner! To think, the all-powerful Mexica emperor is now nothing more than a captive to the invaders!<br> <br> Just today, you received yet another piece of news: Cortés has been killed at the coast! As you suspected, his forces were not strong enough to survive the battle alone. It seems rumors have been circulating in Tenochtitlán. The Mexica have received word of Cortés' death, but the Spaniards have been cut off from this information and wonder about the fate of their former leader.<br> <br> Go to the Tlaxcalan discussion board and discuss the events that have unfolded since you left the city. How do they make you feel about the Spaniards? About the Mexica?

The last time you saw your friends, they left with Cortes to confront Velazquez' men on the coast... and never came back. Though you wonder if they are to be trusted, you have few other options at this point and even fewer friends. <br> <br> Much to your relief, your hosts welcome you with open arms and treat you to a hearty meal. As you gratefully fill your belly, you address the question on everyone's minds: what happened to Cortes? It seems the fate of your former leader will remain a mystery, however. The Tlaxcalan leaders report that they left Cortes and the rest of the contingent as they passed Tlaxcala, taking the opportunity to return home. That was the last they ever saw of him.<br> <br> You then recount the events of the past weeks, but it seems your friends have kept up with the news out of Tenochtitlán and they already know what transpired in the city. All that remains, then, is to make your case. You inform the Tlaxcalan leaders of your plan: you will regroup, consolidate your forces over the coming months, and prepare to lay siege to Tenochtitlán. <a data-passage=\"Tlaxcalans Decide About the Spaniards\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">Will they join you</a>?<br> <br> </span>","Spaniards Kill Aztec Leader":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> You've just received a shocking report from Tenochtitlán: Moctezuma is dead! You can hardly believe the news! It seems there was a riot among the citizens of Tenochtitlán. The Spaniards sent the captive Moctezuma out to calm the crowd and, though he succeeded, the foreigners no longer saw any value in keeping him alive. <br> <br> Moctezuma was your enemy, but he was the most powerful man in the world.

This may be your best chance to do away with your Mexica enemies for good. At the same time, you question the Spaniards' loyalty and wonder if they are, in fact, the greater danger. This decision is not to be taken lightly.<br> <br> After much debate, you decide that the best course of action is to remain neutral. You don't trust anyone at this point and, besides, the longer the Mexica and the Spaniards fight among themselves, the weaker they both become.

Tenochtilán has seemed like a ghost town of late, those who remain weighed down by grief and loss.<br> <br> In the midst of this horror, you are awoken in the dead of night by an attack! It seems the Spaniards have attempted to catch you off guard! Despite the despair that hangs like a cloud over the city, the people are quick to launch a defense. You spent months preparing for just such a fight and now the time has come.<br> <br> The battle is like nothing you've seen before.
