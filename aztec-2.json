drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Character assignment and points selection":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t                        You open your eyes and find yourself staring through an open door at the night sky. The noise you heard was the distant rumble of thunder. <br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are Gerónimo de Aguilar: Spaniard, priest, and a slave among the Mayan people now for eight long years.<br> <br> You lie on your mat upon the floor listening to the thunder, unsettled by a very clear sense that something is about to happen. For now, you have no choice but to wait for God to reveal his plan. In the meantime, you must complete a small task.<br> <br> Use the counter below to develop your character.

Just as you hoped, you are back in Tenochtitlán. And just like every time before, you wake with a clear awareness of your situation. <br> <br>  <b>Your current leader is Moctezuma.</b><br> <br> Six months have passed since the strangers arrived in your city. For six months, you have treated them as guests and watched their every move. They have marveled at your city, recoiled in horror at your temples, and beseeched you to worship their god instead. Strange creatures, these bearded men and their slave woman. You don't trust them. Nobody does. For many moons, you have been weighing your options, carefully plotting the best way to remove them from your city—permanently.<br> <br> As you begin to prepare for your day, you hear word that the Spaniards have received a message. <a data-passage=\"Cortes gets called to the coast\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">This could be just what you need</a>.<br> <br> </span>","Cortes gets called to the coast":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">   Your spies have informed Moctezuma that another army of foreigners have arrived at the shore and they seek the one who calls himself Cortes. The spies have determined that these new Spaniards are not friends of your guests, but Moctezuma decides to keep that information to himself. He visits their lodgings and relays the following message:<br> <br> <i>\"I have just this moment received the information that an armament of eighteen vessels, with a great number of soldiers and horses, has arrived in the harbor where you landed. Pictures of the whole armament have been transmitted to me. This, no doubt, is no news to you, and...though I may have felt hurt that you wished to keep all this a secret from me, yet, on the other hand, I am delighted at the arrival of your brothers, with whom you can now return to Spain; which thus removes all difficulties at once.”</i><br> <br> Moctezuma shares this information with his council afterwards. Though the Spaniards expressed joy at the news, Moctezuma suspects they are worried about what awaits them on the coast.<br> <br> You wonder at what is <a data-passage=\"Toxcatl\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">about to unfold</a>.<br> <br>  </span>","Toxcatl":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  Cortes took his Tlaxcalan allies to the coast three weeks past, but left a large contingent of men behind. It's clear that the people of Tenochtitlán are wary of their presence. Nonetheless, life must go on. Moctezuma has granted permission for an elaborate celebration to be held, the festival of Toxcatl, which will honor the God Huitzilopochtli. For days now, the city has been bustling with energy as everyone prepares.<br> <br> The festival will begin today and the final preparation last night was the installation of an elaborate sculpture of Huitzilopochtli in front of the Templo Mayor. The sculpture is moulded from the ground seeds of the chicolote, a medicinal plant, and adorned in the finest of feathers. You gaze proudly upon this magnificent tribute to your God. You look on as a parade of warriors pass in single file before him, making offerings of food. <br> <br> The drums begin to sound and the greatest warriors in the Aztec Empire start to dance. You watch, mesmerized. As the music reaches a fever pitch, chaos unfolds around you. The Spaniards are attacking the warriors, who have been caught off guard! They cut down the bulk of the mighty Aztec Army in a single blow.<br> <br> As the dust settles, people flood into the plaza. You join the mob in an attempt to hunt down the Spaniards, who have <a data-passage=\"Aztec Leader taken prisoner\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">fled toward the palace</a>.<br> <br>  </span>","Aztec Leader taken prisoner":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  The mob has chased your enemies to the palace and have maintained their assault for hours. To everyone's frustration, the Spaniards have effectively barricaded themselves inside, along with Moctezuma. <br> <br> The assault continues for days, to no avail. There has been no word from Moctezuma since the attack and people fear the worst. Finally, a rumor escapes the palace: word has it that the Spaniards have taken Moctezuma hostage. You are dismayed at this news and shocked that a leader so powerful could fall victim so easily.<br> <br> The assault on the palace proves futile and the city's nobles convince the people to lay down their arms, for now. You must save your energy for the battle that is soon to come. You begin to prepare the city for battle, building new walls, blocking access to canals, and laying traps.

When the residents of Tenochtitlán threw water upon the fire, it only grew stronger.<br> <br> Third, lightning struck the Temple of Xiuhteuctli, despite the fact that it was barely raining.<br> <br> Fourth, a comet fell from the sky in the middle of the day.

Its skull was deformed and reflected the stars, like a mirror.

While you were away at the coast, the remaining Spaniards cut down the Mexica's most powerful warriors in the middle of a religious festival! The residents of the city recovered quickly from their horror and chased down the Spaniards, who retreated from the plaza and barricaded themselves in the palace. They were not alone in the palace, however, for Moctezuma had taken shelter there too. In a shocking move, the Spaniards were able to take him prisoner! To think, the all-powerful Mexica emperor is now nothing more than a captive to the invaders!<br> <br> Just today, you received yet another piece of news: Cortés has returned from the coast! It seems he survived the battle alone, much to your surprise, though his forces have been greatly weakened.

For weeks, the people of Tenochtitlán have been preparing for a battle like nothing the city has ever seen before. You are confident in your advantage over the foreigners, given your knowledge of the city streets and your access to vital resources. Your enemies have been weakened over the past weeks, as the people of the city have denied them food.<br> <br> As the members of the council weigh the options before you, a messenger enters the chamber with a surprising announcement. The Spaniards would like to make an exchange: they will release Moctezuma on the condition that they be allowed to leave the city unharmed. Does your former leader's life still have value to you? Or would you rather have vengeance on your enemies?<br> <br> Go to the Aztec discussion board and consider their offer. You may want to consult with the Spaniards before you make your decision.<br> <br> Option 1: Accept the Spaniard's offer, welcome Moctezuma back, and allow the Spaniards to leave peacefully.<br> <br> Option 2: Refuse the deal. Moctezuma has proven an ineffective leader, and these Spaniards must be dealt with once and for all. <br> <br> When you have made your choice, Tlacaelel must enter your decision.

You will propose an alliance with the Mexica-a risky move, but one that you hope will pay off!<br> <br> You tell your guests that they must fight their battle alone and send them on their way.

Along the way, you prepare your allies for what you might encounter. Your Tlaxcalan friends listen closely and you can't help but wonder at their allegiance. As you prepare to face Velazquez' forces, you are completely at the mercy of your native allies. You do everything in your power to win them over, but is it enough?<br> <br>  You fall into a troubled sleep, wondering what the next morning will bring.<br> <br> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\"><br> <br> You are waiting for the Tlaxcalans to do something.<br> <br> </span>","Tlaxcalans leave Cortes to fend for himself":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> You have received word that the enemy camp lies just ahead.

You decide that the best course of action is not to confront the enemy head on, but to take them by surprise in a sneak attack. <br> <br> You wait until midnight to launch your attack, hoping to catch the enemy forces asleep. You give the command to attack and charge the Spanish camp, but you are missing some of your men! As the enemy forces collect themselves and gather their weapons to fight back, you realize that none of your Tlaxcalan allies are with you. Have you been betrayed? <br> <br> You don't have long to dwell on this fact, for the battle quickly turns against you. You fight for your life, but to no avail.

Many others were not so lucky-a fact that becomes starkly clear as you take stock of the men who now walk beside you. <br> <br> When you feel you have reached a safe distance, Aguilar calls out to your compatriots to stop and recommend they rest a while. As the ragged soldiers settle in and create a makeshift camp with what little supplies they have, you gather your most trusted counselors to weigh your options. <br> <br> Given the conflict with Velazquez back in Cuba and the condition of your ships, escape from the mainland is not an option. Besides, you have witnessed the riches of this land and could never walk away from so great a reward. You inform your men that there is no choice but to lay siege to the city. But will you go it alone or will you return to Tlaxcala and attempt to rebuild your army? If you choose the former, you have no safe place to regroup and will have to launch your attack quickly. You have suffered enormous damages in your escape from the city, but you would  have the element of surprise to strengthen your hand. To succeed at the latter, however, will require the support of the Tlaxcalan people. Do you think you have it?<br> <br> Go to the Spanish discussion board and consider your options. When you have made your decision, Aguilar will input your choice and you may then <a data-passage=\"Spaniards Retreat to Tlaxcala\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">move forward with your plan</a>.<br> <br>  </span>","Spaniards in Tlaxcala Cortes Dead":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> You arrive in Tlaxcala tired and wary. The last time you saw your friends, they left with Cortes to confront Velazquez' men on the coast... and never came back. Though you wonder if they are to be trusted, you have few other options at this point and even fewer friends. <br> <br> Much to your relief, your hosts welcome you with open arms and treat you to a hearty meal. As you gratefully fill your belly, you address the question on everyone's minds: what happened to Cortes? It seems the fate of your former leader will remain a mystery, however. The Tlaxcalan leaders report that they left Cortes and the rest of the contingent as they passed Tlaxcala, taking the opportunity to return home. That was the last they ever saw of him.<br> <br> You then recount the events of the past weeks, but it seems your friends have kept up with the news out of Tenochtitlán and they already know what transpired in the city. All that remains, then, is to make your case.

You have heard that they are powerful warriors who rode upon giant deer to defeat an army at Tlaxcala. Now you will finally meet them face to face. <br> <br> You first lay eyes upon the strangers at the beach, and they are precisely as you have heard: they are dirty and hair grows from their faces. At sea behind them is the biggest canoe you have ever seen. They speak to each other in a strange language, but their message is given to you by a woman who speaks your own tongue. They ask who you are and from whence you came. You tell the strangers that you come from Mexico and you have been sent by the great Moctezuma. You come bearing gifts. <br> <br> The strangers watch in fascination as you lay the gifts at their feet: bolts of cloth, a head fan made of the finest quetzal feathers, and countless trinkets of yellow metal. It is these last items that seem to draw the strangers' attention. You then deliver Moctezuma's message, advising the strangers not to make the journey inland. It is known that they want to meet your leader in person, but such a meeting is not necessary, you tell them. The road is long and dangerous. The strangers refuse your warning, however, and ask you to deliver their request to Moctezuma. They present you with gifts of beads and fine cloth to take back upon your return. <br> <br> Go to the main discussion board and get to know these strange men. What might you want to ask them, given how much you've heard about them? In addition to getting to know each other on the Go to the main discussion board, you may want to talk and strategize within your faction.<br> <br>  You stand awkwardly on the beach, wondering what lies ahead.<br> <br> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\"><br> <br> You are waiting for the Tlaxcalan team to make a decision.<br> <br>  </span>"},"Quest_Points_A":10,"gifts":"Yes","Quest_Points_T":8}
