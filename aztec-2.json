These  were strange, so I took some time to evaluate each one.  \t1. Fiery Comet appeared in the sky and showed itself for a full year. \t2. Fire Consumed the Temple of Huitzilopochtli that could not be put out. When the residents of Tenochtitlan threw water upon the fire, it only grew stronger. \t3. Lightning struck the Temple of Xiuhteuctli, despite the fact that it was barely raining. \t4. A comet, fell from the sky in the middle of the day. The comet has three tails and where they were seen, they made a great noise, like the sound of rattles. \t5. The waters of Lake Texcoco set fire, boiling and bubbling, destroying houses along the shore.  \t6. At night, a woman could be heard crying out, \"0 my children, we are about to go forever.\"\"0 my children, where am I to take you?\" \t7. Residents of Lake Texcoco caught a strange bird, like a crane. Its skull was deformed and reflected the stars, like a mirror. When Moctezuma peered into the mirror, ne saw a group of men marching, outfitted for war and carried on the backs of dee. \t8. Strange creatures appeared in the city, creatures with two heads but only body. When they were taken to Moctezuma, he looked upon them and they disappeared. These signs seem to warn us of a huge threat. We must prepare our warriors for the possibility of war.

We cannot afford to have more invaders coming into our lands and possibly taking the little resources we have available. We must attack and drive these pale-skinned invaders away from our home. Let the \"mighty\" Mexica handle these new creatures to see what they are capable of, then we can take that opportunity to attack both groups and reestablish the power of the Tlaxcalan.  ","XE_Statement":"We have unknown people marching their way towards us. We are not aware of their strengths, so meeting in the battlefield might be a premature decision that could doom the Tlaxcalan people. I recommend we first learn to know these strangers. Learning more information about them will help us determine how we can use them to our benefit. Making an enemy of these people without knowing their strength could be disastrous. ","Max_Statement":"My fellow councilmen, these are scary times. New men we could have never imagined have shown up to our lands. We have seen that they have already spoken to our enemies, the Aztecs, but nothing further. No violence, no remarks, just annoyance. However, this does not mean that they are not a threat to our peoples. We do not know why they are here or how they even arrived. We do not know their names, their ideas, or their language. I say we hold back on releasing our warriors to them and watch them as they move through the lands. Our men are skilled. They will not be seen, and we can hold our own if they are.

action.","TL_St_Voted_ctr":0,"TL_St_Voted_sum":0,"Tl_Attacks_Pu":"No","Mal_Boy":"Aguilar","Mal_Share":"Yes","Letter":0,"Mal_Span":"Yes","Gifts":0,"L_Received":0,"Mutiny_ctr":0,"Mutiny_sum":0,"Mutiny_Voted":0,"Mut_Cor":0,"Mut_Olid":0,"Mutiny_Voted_ctr":0,"Mutiny_Voted_sum":0,"Tlaloc_currentPassage":0,"Spaniards_currentMap":1000,"Tl_Omens":"Spies","TL_Attacks":"No","Olid_Let_Hm":0,"Cortes_Let_Hm":0,"Alvarado_Let_Hm":0,"Garrido_Let_Hm":0,"Causeway_ctr":0,"Causeway_sum":0,"Marina_Let_Hm":0,"Aguilar_Let_Hm":0,"Omens":0,"Tlax_Cause":0,"Tl_IG":0,"Feast_ctr":0,"Feast_sum":0,"Al_TG":0,"Ga_TG":0,"Co_TG":0,"Ol_TG":0,"Ma_TG":0,"Ag_TG":0,"Tlc_Rec":0,"Cu_Rec":0,"Ca_Rec":0,"AP_Rec":0,"Moc_Rec":0,"Az_Ld_Tla_ctr":0,"Az_Ld_Tla_sum":0,"Az_Ld_Vote_ctr":0,"Az_Ld_Vote_sum":0,"Az_Ld_Cua_ctr":0,"Az_Ld_Cua_sum":0,"Az_Ld_Moc_ctr":0,"Az_Ld_Moc_sum":0,"Az_Ld_Cac_ctr":0,"Az_Ld_Cac_sum":0,"Moctezuma_Loyalty_ctr":0,"Moctezuma_Loyalty_sum":0,"Moctezuma_Wisdom_ctr":0,"Moctezuma_Wisdom_sum":0,"Aztec_Mut":"Unanimous","Span_Cho_Att":"No","Sp_Ld_Agu_ctr":0,"Sp_Ld_Agu_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Vote_ctr":0,"Sp_Ld_Vote_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Cor_ctr":0,"Sp_Ld_Cor_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Alv_Teno_ctr":0,"Sp_Ld_Alv_Teno_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Mar_Teno_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Agu_Teno_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Gar_Teno_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Oli_Teno_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Vote_Teno_ctr":0,"Sp_Ld_Vote_Teno_sum":0,"Tlax_Alliance":0,"Cortes_Dead":0,"Riot_ctr":0,"Riot_sum":0,"Riot_Vote_ctr":0,"Riot_Vote_sum":0,"Az_Ld_Dead":0,"Hostage":0,"Moc_Riot_Vote_ctr":0,"Moc_Riot_Vote_sum":0,"MocRiot_Moc_ctr":0,"MocRiot_Moc_sum":0,"MocRiot_Poc_ctr":0,"MocRiot_Poc_sum":0,"MocRiot_Tla_ctr":0,"MocRiot_Tla_sum":0,"MocRiot_Cac_ctr":0,"MocRiot_Cac_sum":0,"MocRiot_Cua_sum":0,"MocRiot_AzP_sum":0,"MocRiot_AzP":0,"MocRiot_Cua":0,"New_Aztec_Leader":0,"Hostage_Exch":0,"Final_Aztec_Players":0,"Final_Aztec_Points":0,"Final_Spanish_Players":0,"Final_Spanish_Points":0,"Final_Tlaxcalan_Players":0,"Final_Tlaxcalan_Points":0,"Final_Span_Tlax_Points":0,"Aguilar_Free":"Yes","Marina_Free":0,"Aguilar_1":"Yes","Malinche_Free":"Yes","Aguilar_2":"Yes","Aguilar_3":"Yes","Malinche_1":"Yes","Malinche_2":"Yes","Malinche_3":"Yes","Mut_Cor_ctr":0,"Mut_Cor_sum":0,"Mut_Olid_ctr":0,"Mut_Olid_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Oli_Teno_ctr":0,"Sp_Ld_Mar_Teno_ctr":0,"MocRiot_Cua_ctr":0,"MocRiot_AzP_ctr":0,"NT_Fight":0,"Sp_Ld_Alv_ctr":0,"Sp_Ld_Olid_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Gar_sum":0,"Sp_Ld_Alv_sum":0,"cause":0,"Sp_Ld_Agu_Teno_ctr":0,"Sp_Ld_Gar_Teno_ctr":0,"Noche":0,"Tlax_Bat":0,"Tlax_Final_Dec":0,"Sp_Peace":0,"Az_Peace":0,"Tl_Peace":0,"Tlax_Az_Peace":0,"Aztec_Tot_Play":0,"Span_Tot_Play":0,"Tlax_Tot_Play":0,"theyrPrivateVars":{},"aztecsMissing":0,"spaniardsMissing":0,"tlaxMissing":0,"totalMissing":0,"factions":{"Aztecs":{"stats":{"Strength":17}},"Spaniards":{"stats":{"Strength":4}},"Tlaxcalans":{"stats":{"Strength":12}}},"world":{"TotalPlayers":0},"users":{"Marina":{"choices":{"Span_Tot_Play":1,"Mut_Cor":0,"Mut_Olid":1,"Mutiny_Voted":1},"faction":"Spaniards","character":"Do&#xf1;a

You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute‚Äîand it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable‚Äîmaybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Quest Intro: The Aztec Legend of Quetzalcoatl":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t        <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">    You must wait for enough players to gather to begin.<br> <br> 0 Spanish players have joined the game.
