You are part of the Aztecs Let me tell you a bit about your people:    You are the mighty Aztec Empire! You are conquerors of central Mexico, who have claimed vast stretches of territory and stricken fear into the hearts of your enemies—the delicious hearts of your enemies! It is now spring of 1519, and you've received word that a group of strange men have landed on your shores. Reports indicate that these men do not come from neighboring states that remain to be conquered, but have instead arrived from the sea, traveling on small islands made of wood. They bring with them giant deer, like nothing seen before, and a group of Mayan slaves. You are curious about these visitors and send a delegation to investigate. What is their purpose here?      is Aztec  Your faction's starting strength is: 7    Now let's <a data-passage=\"The Library\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">learn about your role</a>!</span>","The Library":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">It's eight weeks into the semester and you're already drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Character assignment and points selection":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       You open your eyes and find yourself staring out a window at the night sky. The noise you heard was the distant rumble of thunder.<br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are a powerful Mexica priest. Your role is central to the survival of the Aztec Empire, for it is up to you to commune with the Gods and make sure their needs are met. If the Gods are not happy, the world will fall into chaos.<br> <br> You lie on your mat upon the floor listening to the thunder, unsettled by a very clear sense that something is about to happen. For now, you have no choice but to wait for the Gods to reveal their plan. In the meantime, you must complete a small task.<br> <br> Use the counter below to develop your character.
