I have consistently provided my students with transformative learning experiences and did so even under the most difficult of circumstances. I have engaged in cutting edge pedagogy, whether through historical simulation or the use of AI. I have uplifted my students and modeled for them a commitment equity and social justice that I hope many of them will take into their own classrooms in the future. That desire to have a ripple effect, to help others create powerful learning experiences in classrooms beyond my own, has led me to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, and further integrated my teaching with my scholarship. Stan State is, above all, a teaching institution and I can confidently say that I have exceeded expectations as laid out in our departmental elaborations.

macro-live-block\">It's eight weeks into the semester and you're already drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Character assignment and points selection":"         \t<div class=\"error-view\"><button class=\"error-toggle\" type=\"button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Toggle the error view\" title=\"Toggle the error view\"></button><span class=\"error\">Error: &lt;&lt;run&gt;&gt;: bad evaluation: Window.SugarCubeState.variables.users[role] is undefined</span><pre class=\"error-source\" aria-hidden=\"true\" hidden=\"hidden\"><code>&lt;&lt;run showStats()&gt;&gt;</code></pre></div> \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t         You open your eyes and find yourself on a ship. The boom you heard was the sound of cannon fire and you startle as another shot tears through the sky.<br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are Cristóbal de Olid: Spaniard, soldier, and adventurer, off to seek your fortune in a foreign land. The ship upon which you stand is one of 11 under the command of Hernán Cortés, who has set sail from Cuba against the wishes of the island's Governor (and your good friend), Diego Velazquez. Cortés has convinced you to join him on what may just be your greatest adventure yet and you are eager to escape the clutches of the governor.

You must travel there to claim the heart and secure his blessing. Your journey will be long and difficult, however, and you will need many resources to sustain you if you are to succeed. Collecting these resources is the key to victory. Because the Pochteca is a trader, he knows the terrain well. It is up to him to lead your team in this quest.<br> <br> Do not hesitate in this journey, for you are not the only ones seeking this treasure. Your sworn enemies, the Tlaxcalans, have fought valiantly against you for many years and have resisted conquest. They would deny you the blessing of Quetzalcoatl to claim it for themselves, a feat which would surely fuel their warriors and steel them in their struggle against you.<br> <br> When you have read the following instructions and are ready to begin your quest, click the link below to enter the palace. <br> <br> In the palace you will find 6 place glyphs. Each of these glyphs represents a site of great significance in Central Mexico and in each you will find a vital resource for your journey. In order to collect each resource, you must work with your team to identify the correct name that corresponds with the glyph. Click on each glyph to visit that place and receive a clue to its location. You will need to draw on all your knowledge to solve each puzzle! Once you have figured out where you are, the Pochteca will enter the name into a text box that is only available on his screen. When he enters the correct response, your team will collect the resource located there and you will not be able to return.<br> <br> When you have obtained enough resources to survive your journey, you will be allowed to travel to Cholula. Because the Aztecs have further to travel, they must gather 5 goods, while the Tlaxcalans only require 4. <br> <br> Enter the palace and <a data-passage=\"Scavenger Hunt Hub\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">begin your quest</a>.<br> <br> </span>","2 Return to the Library":"         \t<div class=\"error-view\"><button class=\"error-toggle\" type=\"button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Toggle the error view\" title=\"Toggle the error view\"></button><span class=\"error\">Error: &lt;&lt;run&gt;&gt;: bad evaluation: Window.SugarCubeState.variables.users[role] is undefined</span><pre class=\"error-source\" aria-hidden=\"true\" hidden=\"hidden\"><code>&lt;&lt;run showStats()&gt;&gt;</code></pre></div> \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> A week has passed and every day you've gone back to the library after class, looking for the mysterious room. You've explored every inch of the building, growing increasingly desperate with every day that goes by. Every night you've lain awake for hours, trying to figure out what happened and whether you just imagined the whole thing. You wonder if you're losing your mind, because it sure feels like it.<br> <br> Your history teacher didn't help the situation when she handed back your assignment today. It turns out you really did write it. And you got an A. You now have another assignment due next week and you're extra stressed because now the bar is way too high! Your teacher is going to expect A-level work from you every time and you're just not sure it's in you.<br> <br> It's the end of the day and you know you should go home and get to work on this new assignment, but you just can't stop yourself from going back to the library. It's become an obsession. Just like every other day for the last week, you start on the top floor in the back corner. You brace yourself for the worst, knowing that you won't find what you were looking for, but there it is! You can barely believe your eyes. <br> <br> You carefully reach for the door knob, afraid that it will disappear before you can grasp it. But it doesn't! You turn the handle, give the door a good pull, and it opens to reveal the room exactly as you remember it: books piled high, overstuffed chair, one small table. How is this even happening? This can't be real...can it?<br> <br>   You make your way to the chair and you hear the door swing shut behind you. You sink down into the cushions and close your eyes, confused and relieved all at the same time.

It is known that they want to meet your leader in person, but such a meeting is not necessary, you tell them. The road is long and dangerous. The strangers refuse your warning, however, and ask you to deliver their request to Moctezuma.
