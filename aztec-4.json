drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Character assignment and points selection":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t         You open your eyes and find yourself on a ship. The boom you heard was the sound of cannon fire and you startle as another shot tears through the sky. <br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are Hernán Cortés: Spaniard, soldier, and adventurer, off to seek your fortune in a foreign land. The ship upon which you stand is one of 11 under your command and you have just set sail from Cuba against the wishes of the island's Governor, Diego Velazquez.

He tells you that a pair of messengers have arrived from the coast, bearing beautiful gifts. A group of strangers have come who desire your release and they have paid him handsomely. Your master informs you that you are free and hands you a letter. It reads: <br> <br> “Gentlemen and brothers, here in Cozumel I have learnt that you are captives in the hands of a Cacique, and I pray you that you come here to Cozumel at once, and for this purpose I have sent a ship with soldiers, in case you have need of them, and a ransom to be paid to those Indians with whom you are living. The ship will wait eight days for you. Come in all haste, and you will be welcomed and protected. I am here at this Island with five hundred soldiers and eleven ships, in which I go on, please God, to a town called Tabasco or Potonchan.”<br> <br> You are elated at the message and set out in search of your former companion, Gonzalo Guerrero. Together, you were the sole survivors of the wreck that left you here among the Maya, but unlike you, Guerrero has adopted this new land and forsaken his one true God. Unlike you, Guerrero has not lived out these long years as a slave.<br> <br> When you find him, you share the letter. Guerrero reads it and, much to your dismay, he refuses to leave. “Brother Aguilar,” he says to you, “I am married and have three children and the Indians look on me as a Cacique and captain in wartime,—You go and God be with you, but I have my face tattooed and my ears pierced, what would the Spaniards say should they see me in this guise?”<br> <br> You inform Guerrero that God will never forgive him and <a data-passage=\"Spaniards Quest Instructions 2\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">head off to meet your compatriots</a>.<br> <br> </span>","Spaniards Quest Instructions 2":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  Aguilar, the Spaniards must interview and gain information about the gossip you heard.

You have heard that they are powerful warriors who rode upon giant deer to defeat an army at Tlaxcala. Now you will finally meet them face to face. <br> <br> You first lay eyes upon the strangers at the beach, and they are precisely as you have heard: they are dirty and hair grows from their faces. At sea behind them is the biggest canoe you have ever seen. They speak to each other in a strange language, but their message is given to you by a woman who speaks your own tongue. They ask who you are and from whence you came. You tell the strangers that you come from Mexico and you have been sent by the great Moctezuma. <br> <br> Having decided not to deliver Moctezuma's gifts, you simply deliver his message, advising the strangers not to make the journey inland. It is known that they want to meet your leader in person, but such a meeting is not necessary, you tell them. The road is long and dangerous. The strangers refuse your warning, however, and ask you to deliver their request to Moctezuma. They present you with gifts of beads and fine cloth to take back upon your return. <br> <br> Go to the main discussion board and get to know these strange men. What might you want to ask them, given how much you've heard about them? In addition to getting to know each other on the main discussion board, you may want to talk and strategize within your faction.<br> <br>  You stand awkwardly on the beach, wondering what lies ahead.<br> <br> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\"><br> <br> You are waiting for the Tlaxcalan team to make a decision.<br> <br>  </span>","The Spaniards Head Inland":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  You've been watching the events of the last few weeks closely, wondering what all this might mean for you. The foreigners have no intention of turning back. They are now headed for Tenochtitlán, but must pass through Tlaxcalan lands if they hope to reach their destination.<br> <br> You have never before allowed intruders into your territory and have no intention of doing so now. Are you prepared for their arrival?<br> <br> Exhausted from the events of the last few weeks, you settle down on your sleeping mat and <a data-passage=\"Waking up in the library\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">quickly fall asleep</a> </span>","Waking up in the library":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">You slowly pull yourself awake.  It takes real effort, you were sleeping so deeply.  You're confused, there is nothing worse than waking up mid-dream. <br> <br> What is that noise? Nothing makes sense...<br> <br> You shake your head and catch sight of something glowing on the table next to you. <br> <br> Your phone. It is full of texts from your friends. Where have you been? Is your history assignment done?<br> <br> Your heart starts to race. You look around the room.  The library! Your assignment!  You grab your phone from the table next to you, class starts in just an hour! What are you going to do? <br> <br> It all comes flooding back.  That dream was weird, so realistic, but you came here to get your history paper done. And now you've lost the whole night!<br> <br> You start to gather up your things frantically, praying that somehow you'll find the time to complete the assignment. You knock the pile of books off the little side table next to you, and a neatly stapled stack of paper floats gently to the floor.  <br> <br> You grab it, you look, you start reading.  Your history assignment, it is done!  Did you complete it before you fell asleep? You read more. This is good, like really good! You wrote this? You are pretty sure you are getting an A!<br> <br> You take a deep breath, you gather your things up calmly. You can't believe it. You don't remember writing this brilliant paper, but here it is, done. And you feel rested, if a bit disoriented.  Everything is going to be alright after all! You text your friends.  You'll meet them in class.<br> <br> As you close the door of the weird little room behind you, you know <a data-passage=\"return to the library_no door\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you'll be back</a>.

You couldn't concentrate on anything because all you could think about was that mysterious room and the history assignment you don't remember writing. I mean, you must have written it, right? You feel a little guilty about handing it in, but you decide not to think too hard about that.<br> <br> It's now late afternoon and you're finally free for the day. You hurry back to the library, excited to revisit the mystery room and its big comfy chair. You hope that if you look closely, you'll find some clue to what happened...some indication that you really did write that killer paper.<br> <br> You arrive on the top floor and round the corner but you can't find the door! You swear this is exactly where you found it before, but it's not here. Confused, you scour every corner of the library to no avail. The door is nowhere to be found. You head home feeling deeply unsettled.<br> <br></span>","One of the crew tries to start a mutiny":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> After your encounter with the Mexica, the mood amongst your men has shifted.

Only you can lead them to the gold and the glory that await them! You may want to address them as a group, but it might be more effective to win over each individually.
