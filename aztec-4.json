You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Character assignment and points selection":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       You open your eyes and find yourself staring out a window at the night sky. The noise you heard was the distant rumble of thunder.<br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are a pochteca, a central figure in Mexica society. You are a trader and a spy, travelling long distances throughout the empire to carry information back to Tenochtitlán.<br> <br> You lie on your mat upon the floor listening to the thunder, unsettled by a very clear sense that something is about to happen.

Just as you hoped, you are back in Tenochtitlán. And just like every time before, you wake with a clear awareness of your situation. <br> <br>  Six months have passed since the strangers arrived in your city. For six months, you have treated them as guests and watched their every move. They have marveled at your city, recoiled in horror at your temples, and beseeched you to worship their god instead. Strange creatures, these bearded men and their slave woman. You don't trust them. Nobody does. For many moons, you have been weighing your options, carefully plotting the best way to remove them from your city—permanently.<br> <br> As you begin to prepare for your day, you hear word that the Spaniards have received a message. <a data-passage=\"Cortes gets called to the coast\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">This could be just what you need</a>.<br> <br> </span>","Cortes gets called to the coast":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">   Your spies have informed Moctezuma that another army of foreigners have arrived at the shore and they seek the one who calls himself Cortes. The spies have determined that these new Spaniards are not friends of your guests, but Moctezuma decides to keep that information to himself. He visits their lodgings and relays the following message:<br> <br> <i>\"I have just this moment received the information that an armament of eighteen vessels, with a great number of soldiers and horses, has arrived in the harbor where you landed. Pictures of the whole armament have been transmitted to me. This, no doubt, is no news to you, and...though I may have felt hurt that you wished to keep all this a secret from me, yet, on the other hand, I am delighted at the arrival of your brothers, with whom you can now return to Spain; which thus removes all difficulties at once.”</i><br> <br> Moctezuma shares this information with his council afterwards. Though the Spaniards expressed joy at the news, Moctezuma suspects they are worried about what awaits them on the coast.<br> <br> You wonder at what is <a data-passage=\"Toxcatl\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">about to unfold</a>.<br> <br>  </span>","Absent Cortes Leadership Challenge":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">       Cortes has led you through months of delicate negotations with Moctezuma, but with his departure, it is now time to designate someone you trust as your temporary leader?<br> <br> Go to the discussion board and discuss this decision amongst yourselves.

It's clear that the people of Tenochtitlán are wary of their presence. Nonetheless, life must go on. Moctezuma has granted permission for an elaborate celebration to be held, the festival of Toxcatl, which will honor the God Huitzilopochtli. For days now, the city has been bustling with energy as everyone prepares.<br> <br> The festival will begin today and the final preparation last night was the installation of an elaborate sculpture of Huitzilopochtli in front of the Templo Mayor. The sculpture is moulded from the ground seeds of the chicolote, a medicinal plant, and adorned in the finest of feathers. You gaze proudly upon this magnificent tribute to your God. You look on as a parade of warriors pass in single file before him, making offerings of food. <br> <br> The drums begin to sound and the greatest warriors in the Aztec Empire start to dance. You watch, mesmerized. As the music reaches a fever pitch, chaos unfolds around you. The Spaniards are attacking the warriors, who have been caught off guard! They cut down the bulk of the mighty Aztec Army in a single blow.<br> <br> As the dust settles, people flood into the plaza. You join the mob in an attempt to hunt down the Spaniards, who have <a data-passage=\"Aztec Leader taken prisoner\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">fled toward the palace</a>.<br> <br>  </span>","Aztec Leader taken prisoner":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  The mob has chased your enemies to the palace and have maintained their assault for hours. To everyone's frustration, the Spaniards have effectively barricaded themselves inside, along with Moctezuma. <br> <br> The assault continues for days, to no avail. There has been no word from Moctezuma since the attack and people fear the worst. Finally, a rumor escapes the palace: word has it that the Spaniards have taken Moctezuma hostage. You are dismayed at this news and shocked that a leader so powerful could fall victim so easily.<br> <br> The assault on the palace proves futile and the city's nobles convince the people to lay down their arms, for now. You must save your energy for the battle that is soon to come. You begin to prepare the city for battle, building new walls, blocking access to canals, and laying traps. You cut off supplies to the palace, hoping to starve out the enemy and punish this king who has failed you so.<br> <br>  <a data-passage=\"Cortes Doesn't Return\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">You prepare for war</a>.<br> <br>   </span>","Cortes Doesn't Return":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  With the Spaniards barricaded inside the palace, your people have been quietly preparing the city for battle. With Cortes gone, a much smaller Spanish force remains. Messengers have made their way to the city in recent days, reporting on his demise. It seems Cortes was defeated at the coast and neither he nor his Tlaxcalan allies will be returning. <br> <br> This turn of events gives you hope as you <a data-passage=\"Aztec Leader Gives a Speech\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">continue your preparations</a>.<br> <br>  </span>","Aztec Leader Gives a Speech":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">     Once the city has been adequately prepared for battle, you resume your attack on the palace. The Spaniards have been barricaded inside for days with Moctezuma as their prisoner. You have lost faith in your leader, whose decisions are what brought you to this point.<br> <br> In the midst of your assault, Moctezuma appears on the roof of the palace, demanding to be heard. You put down your weapon as you wait to hear what he has to say. He pleads with you to put down your weapons. They are no match for the Spanish weapons, he tells you. This can only end in tragedy. <br> <br> Is he right? Will this inevitably end in disaster for your people or are you convinced that victory is just around the corner?<br> <br> Each member of the council will cast their individual vote.<br> <br> You have two choices:<br> <br> Option 1: Listen to Moctezuma and attempt to calm the mob that surrounds you. Now is not the time to continue this fight and it's sure to bring <a data-passage=\"Aztecs Decide About The Riot\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">disaster for your people</a>.<br> <br> Option 2: Oppose Moctezuma, who is clearly weak and no longer represents the will of the people.

You join your compatriots as they unleash their anger on the leader who has failed you so. You watch the Spaniards as they attempt to shield him, but just as they drag him from your line of sight, you see Moctezumafall to the ground, struck by one of the many stones hurled by the people below.<br> <br>  Chaos unfolds around you and you <a data-passage=\"Spaniards Kill Aztec Leader Riot\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">wonder what lies ahead for your once-powerful leader</a>.<br> <br>   </span>","Spaniards Kill Aztec Leader Riot":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  It is not long before you learn of Moctezuma's fate. After the chaos died down and people retreated back to their homes, a messenger returned to the roof of the palace bearing the worst possible news: Moctezuma is dead, toppled by the hand of his own people! <br> <br> You yourself watched him fall on the rooftop, but could this really have been his fate? <br> <br> The council gathers in haste. <a data-passage=\"Aztec Leader Dies and Aztecs Choose a Leader Riot\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">Decisions must be made</a>!<br> <br>  </span>","Spaniards Plot their Departure":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  Tension grips the city and you listen as your captors plot their escape. It seems they are deciding whether they should use you as leverage to secure safe passage out of the city. You approach their leader in attempt to plead your case, but it seems he has already made his decision. You have missed your opportunity <a data-passage=\"Offer to Bargain or Not\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">and must wait to learn your fate</a>!<br> <br>  </span>","Noche Triste":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> The whole city flies into action and you watch the chaos that unfolds before you. It seems there have been spies in your midst, for the strangers carry with them a makeshift bridge. Many moons ago, the residents of the city cut off all but one causeway that connects your island city to the shore. This last remaining causeway was itself made unpassable by long broken stretches, but the Spaniards are prepared. You see them lay down their sad little bridge at the first break in the causeway, only to be shot down by the warriors that have flooded into the lake in their canoes.<br> <br> As you run into the fray, cutting down your enemies, you watch as men and horses plummet into the depths of Lake Texcoco. Blinded by the chaos of war, you are vaguely aware that some of the Spaniards have made it down the causeway. Out of the corner of your eye, you watch them scramble to shore, but you must fight where you are and cannot give chase.<br> <br> When the battle is finally done, you survey the scene before you. You wonder how many escaped with their lives. Given the carnage that surrounds you, it cannot have been many. Weary from battle, you thank the gods for your life and <a data-passage=\"Spaniards Decide How to Proceed\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">hope that this tragic chapter is finally done</a>.<br> <br> </span>","Spaniards Decide Whether to Retreat to Tlaxcala":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  As you exit the causeway and the city of Tenochtitlán fades into the distance, you breathe a sigh of relief. You spent seven long months inside the city, surrounded by your enemies and acutely aware of your own vulnerability. The path before you may not yet be clear or free of danger, but your sense of security has improved considerably.<br> <br> It is now time to decide just what that path will be, however. Marina gathers their most trusted counselors to weigh your options. Given the conflict with Velazquez back in Cuba and the condition of your ships, escape from the mainland is not an option. Besides, you have witnessed the riches of this land and could never walk away from so great a reward. <br> <br> There is no choice but to lay siege to the city. But will you go it alone or will you return to Tlaxcala and attempt to rebuild your army? If you choose the former, you have no safe place to regroup and will have to launch your attack quickly, relying on the element of surprise to strengthen your hand. To succeed at the latter, however, will require the support of the Tlaxcalan people. Do you think you have it?<br> <br> Go to the Spanish discussion board and consider your options.

Your spies alerted you to their presence well in advance. <br> <br> You treat your guests to a warm meal and as they settle in, they address the question on everyone's minds: what happened to Cortes? It seems the fate of their former leader will remain a mystery, however. You report that you left Cortes and the rest of the continent as you passed Tlaxcala, taking the opportunity to return home. It seems he never made his way back to Tenochtitlán and that was the last anyone saw of him.<br> <br> They go on to recount the events that transpired after you left the city. When their story is done, they inform you of their plans: they want to regroup, consolidate their forces over the coming months, and prepare to lay siege to Tenochtitlán. And they want your help. <br> <br> The last time Cortes asked you to put your life on the line, you refused. And yet they now ask again. This is different, however. Last time they faced their own enemies and it was not your fight. This time, you have an opportunity to finally defeat the Mexica once and for all. Will you take it?<br> <br> Go to the Tlaxcalan discussion board and weigh your options. You have 4 choices:<br> <br> <b>Option 1:</b> Aid the Spaniards and lay siege to the Aztec capital. These foreigners have proven themselves to be fierce warriors and they have powerful weapons at their disposal. This may be your best chance to claim victory over your Mexica enemies.<br> <br> <b>Option 2:</b> Attack the Spaniards. Though your hatred of the Mexica runs deep, the Spaniards are not to be trusted and you have them in your grasp. Now is your chance to do away with the strangers and restore order to your world.<br> <br> <b>Option 3:</b> Refuse the request and send the strangers on their way. Though your hatred of the Mexica runs deep, the Spaniards are not to be trusted. If you let the two sides continue their fight, they will both come out weaker in the end.<br> <br> <b>Option 4:</b> Lie to the Spaniards to trick them into complacency. Though your hatred of the Mexica runs deep, the Spaniards are not to be trusted. If you join forces with your historical enemies, the foreigners won't stand a chance. You will promise support and then send word to the Mexica, laying a trap that the Spaniards cannot possibly escape. <br> <br> When you have agreed on the best course of action, Xicotencatl_Elder will input your decision.

Tenochtilán has seemed like a ghost town of late, those who remain weighed down by grief and loss.<br> <br> You are thus heartened when a Tlaxcalan messenger arrives with an offer. It seems the Spaniards are headed your way, prepared to launch an attack, and the Tlaxcalans would like to join forces against them.<br> <br> Weakened by the sickness, you would be fools to fight the foreigners alone.

You watch with satisfaction their look of dismay when they see the Tlaxcalans at your side.<br> <br> The battle is like nothing you've seen before. The stakes are high and this will be a fight to the death for both sides.

You have suffered your own losses, however, and now it is time to mourn the dead. <br> <br> Little could you have imagined that you would soon be mourning many more, for it's not long before a new enemy enters the city. Though invisible, this enemy is deadly and it rains death upon the people of Tenochtitlán. You've never seen a sickness like this before, one that kills almost everyone it touches. This can only be a curse from the Gods!<br> <br> The sickness lasts for many moons and by the time it finally leaves, only half the population remains.<br> <br>   Rumors from the mountains begin to <a data-passage=\"Tlaxcala Sides with the Aztecs\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">trickle in</a>.<br> <br> </span>","Aztec Leader Lives and Aztecs Choose a Leader Riot":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">       You gather for a council meeting and decide to elect a new leader.

Your enemies have been weakened over the past weeks, as the people of the city have denied them food.<br> <br> As the members of the council weigh the options before you, a messenger enters the chamber with a surprising announcement. The Spaniards would like to make an exchange: they will release Moctezuma on the condition that they be allowed to leave the city unharmed. Does your former leader's life still have value to you? Or would you rather have vengeance on your enemies?<br> <br> Go to the Aztec discussion board and consider their offer. You may want to consult with the Spaniards before you make your decision.<br> <br> Option 1: Accept the Spaniard's offer, welcome Moctezuma back, and allow the Spaniards to leave peacefully.<br> <br> Option 2: Refuse the deal. Moctezuma has proven an ineffective leader, and these Spaniards must be dealt with once and for all. <br> <br> When you have made your choice, Cuauhtemoc must enter your decision.

You've explored every inch of the building, growing increasingly desperate with every day that goes by. Every night you've lain awake for hours, trying to figure out what happened and whether you just imagined the whole thing. You wonder if you're losing your mind, because it sure feels like it.<br> <br> Your history teacher didn't help the situation when she handed back your assignment today. It turns out you really did write it. And you got an A. You now have another assignment due next week and you're extra stressed because now the bar is way too high! Your teacher is going to expect A-level work from you every time and you're just not sure it's in you.<br> <br> It's the end of the day and you know you should go home and get to work on this new assignment, but you just can't stop yourself from going back to the library. It's become an obsession. Just like every other day for the last week, you start on the top floor in the back corner. You brace yourself for the worst, knowing that you won't find what you were looking for, but there it is! You can barely believe your eyes. <br> <br> You carefully reach for the door knob, afraid that it will disappear before you can grasp it. But it doesn't! You turn the handle, give the door a good pull, and it opens to reveal the room exactly as you remember it: books piled high, overstuffed chair, one small table. How is this even happening? This can't be real...can it?<br> <br>  You make your way to the chair and you hear the door swing shut behind you. You sink down into the cushions and close your eyes, confused and relieved all at the same time.

It's a good thing you asked, because you're expected to participate. The strangers are on their way to Tenochtitlán and the Emperor Moctezuma must decide how to deal with them. To guide his decision, he has sought the counsel of all those who have been party to recent events.<br> <br> In order to prepare for the meeting, you must write a formal statement that you will present to the emperor.
