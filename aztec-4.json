You are part of the Aztecs Let me tell you a bit about your people:    You are the mighty Aztec Empire! You are conquerors of central Mexico, who have claimed vast stretches of territory and stricken fear into the hearts of your enemies—the delicious hearts of your enemies! It is now spring of 1519, and you've received word that a group of strange men have landed on your shores. Reports indicate that these men do not come from neighboring states that remain to be conquered, but have instead arrived from the sea, traveling on small islands made of wood. They bring with them giant deer, like nothing seen before, and a group of Mayan slaves. You are curious about these visitors and send a delegation to investigate. What is their purpose here?      is Aztec  Your faction's starting strength is: 7    Now let's <a data-passage=\"The Library\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">learn about your role</a>!</span>","The Library":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>      <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">It's eight weeks into the semester and you're already drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Name Not Recognized":"        \t<div class=\"error-view\"><button class=\"error-toggle\" type=\"button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Toggle the error view\" title=\"Toggle the error view\"></button><span class=\"error\">Error: &lt;&lt;run&gt;&gt;: bad evaluation: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'factions[faction]['stats']')</span><pre class=\"error-source\" aria-hidden=\"true\" hidden=\"hidden\"><code>&lt;&lt;run showStats()&gt;&gt;</code></pre></div> \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t      <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">Name not recognized.

The wind has caught the sails, and the ship creaks as it begins to heel.  You can barely hear Velázquez yelling into the wind, yelling at Cortés to turn around and come back. Velázquez is mad, and he hasn't yet discovered that, under Cortés' orders, you and the other men have raided the city's main storehouse, stealing all the provisions you hoped would last you through the uncertain adventures ahead. You watch as Cortés cups his hands to his mouth, shouting back to the governor \"Forgive me, Your Worship, for this and similar things have to be done rather than thought about!\" You cast your doubts aside, as Cortés assures you of the riches that undoubtedly lie ahead. <a data-passage=\"Spaniards Quest Instructions 1\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">Without risk, there can be no reward</a>! <br> <br> </span>","Quest Intro: The Aztec Legend of Quetzalcoatl":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> Mexica, over the last 200 years, you have vanquished your enemies one by one to become the most powerful city-state in central Mexico. Your first leader, Acamapichtli, was a son of the Culhua, descended from the Toltecs. This lineage secured his political legitimacy, and with him that of the empire. Religious legitimacy has been harder to come by, however, for it must be granted by the god Quetzalcoatl and the priests who wield his power.<br> <br> Many moons ago, during the time of the 4th sun, Quetzalcoatl walked the Earth and ruled over the sacred city of Tollan. Jealous of his power, Quetzalcoatl's brother, Tezcatlipoca, disguised himself as a sorcerer and tricked Quetzalcoatl into drunkenly cavorting with his sister, the priestess Quetzalpetlatl. The next day, Quetzalcoatl left Tollan in shame, never to return. Quetzalcoatl died in exile, whereupon he was cremated and his remains mixed with the blood of four sacrificed children to symbolize his heart. The heart was then placed in a wooden box and locked in one of the many temples that dot the landscape of central Mexico.

You've become invested in this dream you've been having and you're getting desperate to go back.<br> <br> This afternoon your history professor gave you another assignment and you wonder if this might just be the key to finding that door.

Collecting these resources is the key to victory. Because the Pochteca is a trader, he knows the terrain well. It is up to him to lead your team in this quest.<br> <br> Do not hesitate in this journey, for you are not the only ones seeking this treasure. Your sworn enemies, the Tlaxcalans, have fought valiantly against you for many years and have resisted conquest. They would deny you the blessing of Quetzalcoatl to claim it for themselves, a feat which would surely fuel their warriors and steel them in their struggle against you.<br> <br> When you have read the following instructions and are ready to begin your quest, click the link below to enter the palace. <br> <br> In the palace you will find 6 place glyphs. Each of these glyphs represents a site of great significance in Central Mexico and in each you will find a vital resource for your journey. In order to collect each resource, you must work with your team to identify the correct name that corresponds with the glyph. Click on each glyph to visit that place and receive a clue to its location. You will need to draw on all your knowledge to solve each puzzle! Once you have figured out where you are, the Pochteca will enter the name into a text box that is only available on his screen. When he enters the correct response, your team will collect the resource located there and you will not be able to return.<br> <br> When you have obtained enough resources to survive your journey, you will be allowed to travel to Cholula.

You landed upon the shores of a new land and have been traveling along the coast ever since, meeting different people along the way. Among your many encounters, two stand out.<br> <br> The first occurred early in your journey when you landed upon an island and were approached by the residents, who greeted you with a cry that sounded distinctly like “Castilan, Castilan!” You questioned the local people, who shared a rumor that there were Spaniards living as slaves two days journey inland. You listened to this news with great curiosity, but a storm was coming and you hurried on your way.<br> <br> Further along the coast, you did battle with a fierce group of warriors who you came to know as the Chontal Maya. The battle was bloody, but it was decided in the end by your cavalry. The warriors gazed in terror at your horses, clearly overwhelmed and confused at a creature they had never before seen. As part of their peace offering, they presented you with twenty slave women. You were told that one of them possesses many skills, including the gift of language.<br> <br> It is now time to <a data-passage=\"Spaniards Quest Instructions 2\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">investigate these two individuals</a>.<br> <br> </span>","Spaniards Quest Instructions 2":"        \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  Congratulations! You have sucessfully completed the quest!  You may now continue <a data-passage=\"On The Way to Veracruz\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">on your journey</a>!<br> <br>  </span>","On The Way to Veracruz":"        \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> It is clear that the new members of your expedition possess an invaluable skill: language. As you make your way up the coast, the language that has only begun to sound familiar gives way to something entirely new. Aguilar informs you that you have left Maya territory and are now surrounded by a language called Nahuatl. Thus begins a three-way process of translation: Marina translates the Nahuatl into Mayan and the priest Aguilar, in turn, translates the Mayan into Spanish. <br> <br> You reach the end or your journey up the coast, landing at a site that you decide to name Villa Rica de Vera Cruz—<a data-passage=\"Spaniards hear rumors about a delegation approaching the coast\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">the Rich Village of the True Cross</a>. <br> <br> </span>","Spaniards hear rumors about a delegation approaching the coast":"        \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> Since arriving at the coast of Veracruz, you've been visited by emissaries from a number of nearby villages. In all of these interactions, Marina has proven her value, translating for Aguilar, who has in turn been able to convey information to the rest of the team. Through the visitors, you've gained important intelligence. Most significantly, you've learned many things about the rich and powerful kingdom that lies to the west. This land is called Mexico and its ruler, Moctezuma, has made many enemies in the lands that lie between you.<br> <br>   One day, you hear rumors of a <a data-passage=\"On a Beach in Veracruz: Gifts\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">delegation approaching</a>.<br> <br> </span>","On a Beach in Veracruz: Gifts":"        \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> Your curiosity about these frightful Mexica is finally satisfied when a delegation arrives at the village. They tell you that they come in the name of the great Emperor, Moctezuma, and each man bows to kiss the earth. After welcoming you to their territory, they present you with a bounty of gifts: mountains of beautiful cotton cloth, plumes of feathers more brilliant and colorful than any you've seen before...and gold. Countless trinkets of gold glisten before you in the sunlight.<br> <br> After presenting their gifts, the men deliver a message on behalf of their prince, Moctezuma. Their leader, they claim, “was pleased that such valiant men, as he had heard they were, should come to his country,” for Moctezuma had heard reports of your battle in Tabasco. However, the men assure you that there is no need for a meeting between your two sides. In fact, they tell you the journey to Mexico is treacherous and you would best head back the way you came.<br> <br> Cortes responds to the men. He tells them that you've traveled many miles to meet their great and powerful prince and you have no fear of the journey that lies ahead. He gives the men gifts of beads and linen shirts to take back and asks that they convey his request for a meeting.<br> <br> Go to the main discussion board and get to know these strange men. What might you want to ask them, given how much you've heard about them? In addition to getting to know each other on the Go to the main discussion board, you may want to talk and strategize within your faction.<br> <br>  Once you've completed your meeting, you watch the Aztecs head home. Turning to face the rest of your companions, you wonder how this meeting <a data-passage=\"One of the crew tries to start a mutiny\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">will impact their enthusiasm for this trip</a>.<br> <br>  </span>","One of the crew tries to start a mutiny":"        \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> After your encounter with the Mexica, the mood amongst the men has shifted. There is excitement about the riches that may well lie inland, but there is also a clear current of unease. You've always questioned Cortés' abilities and his betrayal of your friend Velazquez left a bitter taste in your mouth. Like Cortés, you are convinced that the journey inland could bring you untold riches, but you do not have faith in his leadership. Besides, whoever leads the expedition will surely be rewarded by the King. Now is your chance to take that victory for yourself!<br> <br> You must convince the others that you will make a better leader than Cortés. Go to Discord and convince them to mutiny. It is of the utmost importance that Cortés not find out, however, so be discrete in your interactions. You don't want to get caught!<br> <br> Once you have done all you can to convince your teammates, continue <a data-passage=\"Mutiny Outcome\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">to the next screen to find out if you have succeeded</a>. <br> <br> </span>","Mutiny Outcome":"        \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>      <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  You must wait until all the Spaniards have decided where their loyalties lie. <br> <br> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\"><br> <br> 2 votes have been cast.  </span>"},"chatlog":{"Aztecs":[],"Spaniards":[],"Tlaxcalans":[],"chat":[]}}
