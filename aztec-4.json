drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Character assignment and points selection":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       You open your eyes and find yourself staring through an open door at the night sky. The noise you heard was the distant rumble of thunder. <br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are a Nahua girl of just 16 years. Born in Coatzacoalcos, you were sold into slavery and have been living as a slave among the Chontal Maya for many moons now. <br> <br> You lie on your mat upon the floor listening to the thunder, unsettled by a very clear sense that something is about to happen. For now, you have no choice but to wait for the Gods to reveal their plan. In the meantime, you must complete a small task. <br> <br> Use the counter below to develop your character. You have 20 points, which you may distribute however you choose between qualities: strength, loyalty, and wisdom.

You head for the top floor, round the corner, and there's the door! Eager to get back to Tenochtitlán, you slip inside and flop out in the chair.

Just as you hoped, you are back in Tenochtitlán. And just like every time before, you wake with a clear awareness of your situation. <br> <br>  Six months have passed since you arrived in the city. For six months, you have been a guest of Moctezuma, but with every day that passes you feel less like a guest and more like a prisoner. You feel eyes upon you everywhere you go. The Emperor has assured you of your safety and has never shown you anything less than respect, but you don't trust him. You've lain awake every night for weeks, as the nagging dread that lingers at the back of your mind during the day takes over your thoughts.<br> <br> You rouse yourself out of bed and prepare for another day of wondering and waiting, thinking about how you might force Moctezuma's hand. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Cortes gets called to the coast\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">a messenger arrives at your lodgings</a>.<br> <br> </span>","Cortes gets called to the coast":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> Moctezuma gathers you together and this is what he says:<br> <br> <i>\"I have just this moment received the information that an armament of eighteen vessels, with a great number of soldiers and horses, has arrived in the harbor where you landed. Pictures of the whole armament have been transmitted to me. This, no doubt, is no news to you, and...though I may have felt hurt that you wished to keep all this a secret from me, yet, on the other hand, I am delighted at the arrival of your brothers, with whom you can now return to Spain; which thus removes all difficulties at once.”</i><br> <br> You listen to Cortes express his joy to Moctezuma, assuring him how happy he and his men will be to reunite with their countrymen. You sense something is not right, however.<br> <br> After Moctezuma makes his departure, Cortes gathers everyone together and expresses his concern. He suspects this army has arrived to arrest him, though it's not clear to you what for. Cortes will go to the coast and he will take an army of indigenous allies on the journey, among them the Tlaxcalan leaders. <br> <br> <a data-passage=\"Absent Cortes Leadership Challenge\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">Everyone prepares for Cortes' departure</a>.<br> <br>  </span>","Absent Cortes Leadership Challenge":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">       Cortes has led you through months of delicate negotations with Moctezuma, but with his departure, it is now time to designate someone you trust as your temporary leader?<br> <br> Go to the discussion board and discuss this decision amongst yourselves.

Moctezuma has granted permission for an elaborate celebration to be held, the festival of Toxcatl, which will honor the God Huitzilopochtli.  For days now, the city has been bustling with energy as the residents prepare.<br> <br> The festival will begin today and the final preparation last night was the installation of an elaborate sculpture of Huitzilopochtli in front of the Templo Mayor. The sculpture is moulded from the ground seeds of the chicolote, a medicinal plant, and adorned in the finest of feathers. It is a remarkable piece of workmanship. You look on as a parade of warriors pass in single file before the God, making offerings of food. <br> <br> The drums begin to sound and the greatest warriors in the Aztec Empire start to dance. You find yourself mesmerized. As the music reaches a fever pitch, chaos unfolds around you. The Spaniards are attacking the warriors, who have been caught off guard. They cut down the bulk of the mighty Aztec Army in a single blow.<br> <br> As the dust settles, people flood into the plaza and you feel yourself surrounded. You join your companions as they flee the plaza and <a data-passage=\"Aztec Leader taken prisoner\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">head for the palace</a>.<br> <br>  </span>","Aztec Leader taken prisoner":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> A mob has quickly gathered and filled the streets, eager to take revenge for your actions in the plaza. You make your way to the palace and barricade yourselves inside. The mob assaults the palace with a flurry of stones, arrows, and javelins, but your men are able to fend them off. You are safe, for now.<br> <br> As you consider your next move, Olid suggests that your first step should be to deal with Moctezuma, who is currently somewhere in the plaza, surely plotting his revenge. Olid proposes a bold plan: you will take Moctezuma prisoner.<br> <br> Your men spread out through the palace and succeed in locating Moctezuma. You put him in shackles and inform him that he is now your prisoner. If he wants to remain alive, he will do your bidding. <br> <br> For days, the assault on the palace continues. When it finally stops, so does the supply of food into the palace.<br> <br>  Things are eerily calm and you wait.<br> <br> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\"><br> <br> You are waiting for the Tlaxcalans to do something.<br> <br>  </span>","Cortes Doesn't Return":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> Things have now been quiet for days.

You are hungry and outnumbered. Desperate to bring the siege to an end so you can make your escape, you decide to deploy the best weapon you have at your disposal: Moctezuma.<br> <br> You take him to the roof of the palace and demand that he bring a stop to the assault. Moctezuma steps to the edge of the roof and the volley of rocks and arrows comes to a halt. He speaks to his people, pleading with them to put down their weapons. They are no match for your weapons, he tells them, and this can only end in tragedy. <br> <br>   You observe warily, trying to gauge <a data-passage=\"Aztecs Riot\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">the crowd's response</a>! <br> <br>   </span>","Aztecs Riot":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  It appears that the crowd has lost faith in their leader. Despite his pleas, the crowd below has begun to riot, hurling stones towards the rooftop. You watch Moctezuma fall to his knees as he is struck in the head.<br> <br> Moctezuma is gravely wounded, but alive. Given his inability to calm the crowd below, you wonder if his usefulness has run its course. Go to the Spanish discussion board and contemplate the value of continuing to keep Moctezuma as your prisoner. What are the benefits of saving his life? What are the potential costs? You have two choices: keep him alive and in shackles or dispose of him... for good.<br> <br>  Alvarado will input your decision. Once you have made your choice, you may carry on.<br> <br> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\">   </span>","Spaniards Kill Aztec Leader Riot":"      \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t     <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"> You have decided that the risk of keeping Moctezuma alive outweighs the benefit. This injury at the hands of his people has provided you with an excellent opportunity: you can put an end to him and they will never know. You decide to finish him off and send him to meet his Gods. <br> <br> You send a messenger to the roof of the palace to inform the residents of Tenochtitlán that their leader is dead, brought down by the hands of his own people! Though you fear another riot, the city remains strangely calm.

You will need to be quick and silent, so you decide carefully what is worth taking. After all this time coveting Moctezuma's treasure, however, you can't help but fill your pockets with all the gold and valuables you can find.

As you gather your final supplies, you thank God for the spy who kept you informed about the Mexica's many preparations for battle. You know that only one causeway to the mainland remains and that parts have been destroyed, leaving it impassible. When you learned this, your men gathered wood and built a portable bridge, which you now take with you. <br> <br> As quietly as any army that has gone before, you make your way out of the palace through the eerie darkness towards the last remaining causeway. It is all for naught, however! You have been spotted and you watch the lake that surrounds you fill with canoes. Mexica warriors descend upon you from all sides! As you approach the first break in the causeway, your men put down the portable bridge and you are able to cross, but others are not so lucky. The bridge collapses under the weight of so many men and you carry bits of wood in a feeble attempt to cross the next break in the causeway. Chaos surrounds you as men and horses plummet into the depths of Lake Texcoco.<br> <br> Somehow, you make it out alive, but not all are so lucky.

The last time you saw your friends, they left with Cortes to confront Velazquez' men on the coast... and never came back. Though you wonder if they are to be trusted, you have few other options at this point and even fewer friends. <br> <br> Much to your relief, your hosts welcome you with open arms and treat you to a hearty meal. As you gratefully fill your belly, you address the question on everyone's minds: what happened to Cortes? It seems the fate of your former leader will remain a mystery, however.
