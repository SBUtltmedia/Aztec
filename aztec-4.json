drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute—and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br> <br> It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br> <br> The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br> <br> You unload your books and make yourself comfortable—maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br> <br> Suddenly, <a data-passage=\"Character assignment and points selection\" class=\"link-internal macro-link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">you're startled by a loud noise</a>!<br> <br></span>","Character assignment and points selection":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t         You open your eyes and find yourself on a ship. The boom you heard was the sound of cannon fire and you startle as another shot tears through the sky. <br> <br> You are momentarily disoriented, but this passes quickly as you realize that you somehow know exactly where—and who—you are. You are Hernán Cortés: Spaniard, soldier, and adventurer, off to seek your fortune in a foreign land. The ship upon which you stand is one of 11 under your command and you have just set sail from Cuba against the wishes of the island's Governor, Diego Velazquez.

He tells you that a pair of messengers have arrived from the coast, bearing beautiful gifts. A group of strangers have come who desire your release and they have paid him handsomely. Your master informs you that you are free and hands you a letter. It reads: <br> <br> “Gentlemen and brothers, here in Cozumel I have learnt that you are captives in the hands of a Cacique, and I pray you that you come here to Cozumel at once, and for this purpose I have sent a ship with soldiers, in case you have need of them, and a ransom to be paid to those Indians with whom you are living. The ship will wait eight days for you. Come in all haste, and you will be welcomed and protected. I am here at this Island with five hundred soldiers and eleven ships, in which I go on, please God, to a town called Tabasco or Potonchan.”<br> <br> You are elated at the message and set out in search of your former companion, Gonzalo Guerrero. Together, you were the sole survivors of the wreck that left you here among the Maya, but unlike you, Guerrero has adopted this new land and forsaken his one true God. Unlike you, Guerrero has not lived out these long years as a slave.<br> <br> When you find him, you share the letter. Guerrero reads it and, much to your dismay, he refuses to leave. “Brother Aguilar,” he says to you, “I am married and have three children and the Indians look on me as a Cacique and captain in wartime,—You go and God be with you, but I have my face tattooed and my ears pierced, what would the Spaniards say should they see me in this guise?”<br> <br> You inform Guerrero that God will never forgive him and <a data-passage=\"Spaniards Quest Instructions 2\" class=\"link-internal\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">head off to meet your compatriots</a>.<br> <br> </span>","Spaniards Quest Instructions 2":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  Aguilar, the Spaniards must interview and gain information about the gossip you heard.

Each of these glyphs represents a site of great significance in Central Mexico and in each you will find a vital resource for your journey. In order to collect each resource, you must work with your team to identify the correct name that corresponds with the glyph. Click on each glyph to visit that place and receive a clue to its location. You will need to draw on all your knowledge to solve each puzzle! Once you have figured out where you are, you will enter the name into a text box that is only available on your screen. When you enters the correct response, your entire team will collect the resource located there and you will not be able to return.<br> <br> When you have obtained enough resources to survive your journey, you will be allowed to travel to Cholula.

When the residents of Tenochtitlán threw water upon the fire, it only grew stronger.<br> <br> Third, lightning struck the Temple of Xiuhteuctli, despite the fact that it was barely raining.<br> <br> Fourth, a comet fell from the sky in the middle of the day. The comet had three tails and where they were seen, they made a great noise, like the sound of rattles.<br> <br> Fifth, the waters of Lake Texcoco set fire, boiling and bubbling, destroying houses along the shore.<br> <br> Sixth, at night, a woman could  be heard crying out, “O my children, we are about to go forever.” “O my children, where am I to take you?”<br> <br> Seventh, the residents of Lake Texcoco caught a strange bird, like a crane. Its skull was deformed and reflected the stars, like a mirror.

At sea behind them is the biggest canoe you have ever seen. They speak to each other in a strange language, but their message is given to you by a woman who speaks your own tongue. They ask who you are and from whence you came. You tell the strangers that you come from Mexico and you have been sent by the great Moctezuma. <br> <br> Having decided not to deliver Moctezuma's gifts, you simply deliver his message, advising the strangers not to make the journey inland. It is known that they want to meet your leader in person, but such a meeting is not necessary, you tell them. The road is long and dangerous. The strangers refuse your warning, however, and ask you to deliver their request to Moctezuma. They present you with gifts of beads and fine cloth to take back upon your return. <br> <br> Go to the main discussion board and get to know these strange men. What might you want to ask them, given how much you've heard about them? In addition to getting to know each other on the main discussion board, you may want to talk and strategize within your faction.<br> <br>  You stand awkwardly on the beach, wondering what lies ahead.<br> <br> <img src=\"Twine/images/Stop_1.png\" style=\"width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;\"><br> <br> You are waiting for the Tlaxcalan team to make a decision.<br> <br>  </span>","The Spaniards Head Inland":"         \t \t \t \t \t<span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\"></span> \t <br>    \t       <span class=\"macro-live macro-live-block\">  You've been watching the events of the last few weeks closely, wondering what all this might mean for you.

A thunderous sound bears down upon you and soon you are confronted by a herd of giant deer! The strangers sit perched atop them and they rush upon you, tearing at you with knives! <br> <br> A bloody battle ensues. It lasts many days and you kill many of their men, but their weapons are too much for you and you are overwhelmed by the giant deer that they ride into battle.

Perhaps you can use their strength to your advantage. <br> <br> Forming an alliance with the Spaniards seems like the wisest option, but will you do so in good faith? Do you trust these strangers to help you confront your Aztec enemy or might you be able to manipulate them?

You killed many of their men in battle and there are only 250 of them left, but they are skilled warriors and—even more important—they carry powerful weapons.

The people of Cholula were your loyal allies for many years, until they betrayed you to become loyal vassals of the Mexica. There is bad blood between you and you long to make the cowardly Cholulans pay for their betrayal.<br> <br> As you approach the city, your blood boils, but you remain calm and alert.

At sea behind them is the biggest canoe you have ever seen. They speak to each other in a strange language, but their message is given to you by a woman who speaks your own tongue. They ask who you are and from whence you came. You tell the strangers that you come from Mexico and you have been sent by the great Moctezuma. You come bearing gifts. <br> <br> The strangers watch in fascination as you lay the gifts at their feet: bolts of cloth, a head fan made of the finest quetzal feathers, and countless trinkets of yellow metal. It is these last items that seem to draw the strangers' attention. You then deliver Moctezuma's message, advising the strangers not to make the journey inland. It is known that they want to meet your leader in person, but such a meeting is not necessary, you tell them. The road is long and dangerous. The strangers refuse your warning, however, and ask you to deliver their request to Moctezuma.
