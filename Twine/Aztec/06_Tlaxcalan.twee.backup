For days now, you've been worried about events outside your control. It's clear the Aztecs are preparing for something, but you have no way to know what this is.<br>
<br>
For three nights straight, you haven't slept a wink. You've lain awake worrying and trying to mentally prepare for what might lie ahead. After so many sleepless days, you're exhausted and you lie down upon your reed mat for the night. As soon as you close your eyes, you slip into a deep sleep. <br>

<<liveblock>>
You return from your journey to find the village buzzing with news. One of your spies has just returned from the coast, where a band of strangers recently arrived from across the sea. The strangers are pale in skin and covered in hair. They have been giving gifts to people of the coast and winning their affection. These coastal people are allied to the Mexica, but have been brutalized by them. Like so many others in the empire, they harbor deep resentment for their Aztec overlords.<br>
<br>
Rumor has it that the strangers have been warned about the Mexica, but show little fear. They have asked many questions about the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán and how they might reach it.<br>
<br>
Go to the Tlaxcalan discussion board and discuss amongst yourselves how you feel about this news.<br>

<br>
Tlaxcalans, over the last 200 years, you have watched the Mexica vanquish their enemies one by one to become the most powerful city-state in central Mexico. Their first leader, Acamapichtli, was a son of the Culhua, descended from the Toltecs. This lineage secured his political legitimacy, and with him that of his empire. Religious legitimacy has been harder to come by, however, for it must be granted by the god Quetzalcoatl and the priests who wield his power. <br>
<br>
Many moons ago, during the time of the 4th sun, Quetzalcoatl walked the Earth and ruled over the sacred city of Tollan. Jealous of his power, Quetzalcoatl's brother, Tezcatlipoca, disguised himself as a sorcerer and tricked Quetzalcoatl into drunkenly cavorting with his sister, the priestess Quetzalpetlatl. The next day, Quetzalcoatl left Tollan in shame, never to return. Quetzalcoatl died in exile, whereupon he was cremated and his remains mixed with the blood of four sacrificed children to symbolize his heart. The heart was then placed in a wooden box and locked in one of the many temples that dot the landscape of central Mexico. The priests who guard this temple hold great power and only they can grant <<link "the blessing that you seek" "Quest: Tlaxcalan instructions">><<set $Tlaxcalans_currentMap=2>><</link>>.<br>

You have much to prove to Xicotencatl the Elder, and this is your chance. It is up to you to lead your team on this quest!<br>

If you succeed, you will deny legitimacy to the Mexica and maintain the balance of power in central Mexico.

In the palace you will find 6 place glyphs. Each of these glyphs represents a site of great significance in Central Mexico and in each you will find a vital resource for your journey. In order to collect each resource, you must work with your team to identify the correct name that corresponds with the glyph. Click on each glyph to visit that place and receive a clue to its location. You will need to draw on all your knowledge to solve each puzzle!

<br>

<i>“The next morning we reached the broad high road of Iztapalapan, whence we for the first time beheld the numbers of towns and villages built in the lake, and the still greater number of large townships on the mainland, with the level causeway which ran in a straight line into Mexico. Our astonishment was indeed raised to the highest pitch, and we could not help remarking to each other, that all these buildings resembled the fairy castles we read of in Amadis de Gaul; so high, majestic, and splendid did the temples, towers, and houses of the town, all built of massive stone and lime, rise up out of the midst of the lake. Indeed, many of our men believed what they saw was a mere dream. And the reader must not feel surprised at the manner in which I have expressed myself, for it is impossible to speak coolly of things which we had never seen nor heard of, nor even could have dreamt of, beforehand.” (Lockhart, 219)</i><br>

Your first task is to go to your game documents and read Bernal Diaz' account of Tenochtitlán, where you will find a detailed description of the Tlatelolco Market. When everyone has finished reading, the Tlaxcalans will choose one team member to start a new page on their site titled “Tlatelolco Market: Insider's Guide.” You must work with them to create a special entry for the Spanish guidebook.<br>
<br>
LIke any good insider's guide, the entry should include:<br>
<br>
An introduction that describes the specific location<br>
An account of which sights live up to the hype and which ones do not<br>
The best bargains to be found<br>
Instructions on where to eat like a local and how to avoid tourist traps<br>
<br>
Pay attention to detail, because there are points at stake here!<br>

With the pochteca as your guide, you set out across the city. You are eager to visit the legendary Tlatelolco Market and to be the first Tlaxcalans ever to lay eyes upon its fabled riches. You are halfway to your destination when you are approached by a messenger. He has come to assign you a task.<br>
<br>
The messenger informs you that the Spaniards have decided to create a guide to the city that will provide useful advice to future explorers. Given the importance of Tlatelolco Market, it must occupy a central place in the guide. However, the Spaniards worry that they will be unfamiliar with many of the riches to be found there and that their description may not do it justice. They would like to enlist your help.<br>

You watch your allies enter the city of Cholula where they will consort with your enemy. When they are out of sight, you send out spies to keep watch. It is clearly to your benefit to know exactly what goes on inside the city walls.<br>
<br>
You remain at camp, curious to learn what's going on inside the city walls. Your spies have yet to return. You wait anxiously for news.<br>

The first day and night pass quietly, with little news from inside. The next morning, however, your spies come running back to camp just as you hear the sound of screaming from inside the city.<br>
<br>
The Aztecs have laid a trap and attacked the Spaniards! This will surely be a massacre and an Aztec victory would not be to your benefit. You rush through the city gates and engage your enemies in battle. You fight your way back out of the city with your Spanish allies at your side. They made it out alive, but barely. <br>

You head for the mountains, eager to get [[beyond the reach of the Aztec warriors|Into the Mountain Pass]].<br>

You make your way to the city, eager to raid Cholula's stores of salt and cloth--items that you've been denied by an Aztec embargo.<br>

<<if $role is "Cortes">>
You have received word that the enemy camp lies just ahead. The time has come to face the force of Spaniards who have come to secure your arrest.<br>
<br>
You confer with your Tlaxcalan allies, who assure you they will fight by your side. You decide that the best course of action is not to confront the enemy head on, but to take them by surprise in a sneak attack.<br>
<br>
You wait until midnight to launch your attack, hoping to catch the enemy forces asleep. After a quick and bloody battle, you succeed in capturing their leader, Pánfilo Narváez, who miraculously survives being stuck in the eye with a pike. You put Narváez in chains, disarm the remainder of his men, and give them a choice: return to Cuba or join you in Tenochtitlán. <br>
<br>
Fortunately for you, these men are no fools. They have heard tales of the great Mexica city and the riches found there. Hundreds of them choose to join you. You have just quadrupled your forces. This could not have gone better.<br>
<br>
<<link "As you prepare for the journey back to Tenochtitlán" "Cortes Returns Victorious">><<set $factions["Spaniards"]["stats"]["Strength"]+=5>><</link>>you take possession of Narváez' cannons, and your team's strength increases significantly.

<<else>>
You have received word that the enemy camp lies just ahead. The time has come to face yet another force of Spaniards in battle.<br>
<br>
As you approach the camp, Cortes proposes a plan: rather than meet his enemies head on, he wants to catch them off guard in a surprise attack. You agree that this is the best chance for success and wait patiently for nightfall.<br>
<br>
You wait until midnight to launch your attack, hoping to catch the enemy forces asleep. After a quick and bloody battle, you succeed in capturing the leader and disarming his men. When Cortes gives them the choice of going back where they came from or joining you on the return journey, very few choose to turn back. Your force has just grown considerably. You make your way back to Tenochtitlán.<br>
<br>
As you depart the scene of the battle, Cortes instructs you to take the large and terrifying weapons that these new Spaniards brought with them. He tells you they are called cannons and asks you to take them to Tlaxcala for safekeeping. [[You prepare to finally return home|Tlaxcalans Back In Tlaxcala]].<br>

Much to your dismay, your fears turn out to be valid. As you near Tlaxcala,  <<print $Tlax_Leader>> informs you that he and his men will not be carrying on the rest of the way. They will remain in Tlaxcala, leaving you to face the enemy with a greatly-diminished force.<br>
<br>
This news comes as a terrible blow. The odds are no longer in your favor.<br>
<br> 
You spend the night in Tlaxcala and lie awake all night weighing your next move. Will you try to catch Velazquez' men off guard in a sneak attack or is it safer to negotiate an agreement?<br>
<br>
Think carefully about this decision. What are the potential repercussions of either choice? Which is the right move? Once you have made your decision, select your choice below.<br>

<<else>>
As you near home, you feel your heart soar. You have been away for many moons, a stranger in a foreign land. It is now time to tell Cortes that you will not be at his side when he meets his enemy at the coast. <br>
<br>
Cortes takes the news with a steely glare and it is clear that he is not happy with the news. With the loss of your men, his forces are greatly diminished. But this is not your battle to fight.<br>

You host the troops for the night and see them on their way the next morning, [[content to remain where you are|Tlaxcalans Back In Tlaxcala]].<br>

The Aztec capital may be impressive, rising up from the lake, but it's teeming with your enemies. You have battled the Aztecs many times before. Is this time any different? You lead an army of 10,000 allies who share your hatred of the Aztecs. The Spanish force is small, but they carry powerful weapons and they ride their giant deer.<br>
<br>
This is your final opportunity to weigh your options before you reach the point of no return. Go to the Tlaxcalan discussion board and decide on your best course of action. <br>
<br>
Option 1: This is your best chance to defeat the Aztecs. You've waited years for this opportunity and you're not about to let it slip away from you now! You will carry on to the city.<br>
<br>
Option 2: You have serious doubts about the Spaniards in your camp. Recent events have led you to wonder if they might be a more immediate threat than your Aztec enemies. You send a messenger to Tenochtitlán to negotiate an alliance.<br>
<br>
Option 3: You have serious doubts about the Spaniards in your camp. You wonder if they're leading you into a losing battle with the hated Aztecs. You decide to cut your losses. You leave the Spaniards to their fate and head for home.<br>
<br>
Option 4: You have long doubted the Spaniards in your camp and already made a secret alliance with the Aztecs. After recent events, you are more convinced than ever that this was the right decision. You will honor your alliance with the Aztecs and enter the city as friends.<br>
