Through the visitors, you've gained important intelligence. Most significantly, you've told them many things about the rich and powerful kingdom that lies to the west.

November 18th, 1519.  Just off the shore of Cuba. <br>
<br>
You stand on the deck of the ship watching the city of Santiago de Cuba recede towards the horizon.  The wind has caught the sails, and the ship creaks as it begins to heel.  You can barely hear Velázquez yelling into the wind, yelling at Cortés to turn around and come back.

Velázquez is mad, and he hasn't yet discovered that, under Cortés' orders, you and the other men have raided the city's main storehouse, stealing all the provisions you hoped would last you through the uncertain adventures ahead.

You watch as Cortés cups his hands to his mouth, shouting back to the governor "Forgive me, Your Worship, for this and similar things have to be done rather than thought about!"

You cast your doubts aside, as Cortés assures you of the riches that undoubtedly lie ahead. [[Without risk, there can be no reward|Spaniards Quest Instructions 1]]!

:: Spaniards Battle the Tabascans [Done Breaks] {"position":"1525,825","size":"100,100"}
<<liveblock>>
You continue along the coast, stopping next at a place called Tabasco. <br>
<br>
As you make your way inland, curious what lies ahead, you hear the sound of drums. You barely have time to process the sound before you realize that you've been surrounded by an entire army of native warriors, their faces painted in black and white, armed bows and arrows, lances, slings, and stones.<br>
<br>
Recalling this event years later, Bernal Diaz wrote: 
“they rushed upon us like mad dogs completely surrounding us, and they let fly such a cloud of arrows, javelins and stones that on the first assault they wounded over seventy of us...I remember that when we fired shots the Indians gave great shouts and whistles and threw dust and rubbish into the air so that we should not see the damage done to them, and they sounded their trumpets and drums and shouted and whistled and cried ‘Alala! Alala!'”<br>
<br>
Your battle with the Tabascans was fierce, but in the end it was the cavalry that secured your victory. Your horsemen arrived late to the battle and overwhelmed the native force. You manage to take five captives and send two of them back to their leader, laden with beads and gifts. Speaking in the strange native tongue, Aguilar instructs them to deliver a message: The native peoples of this land have nothing to fear, for you come in peace. <br>
<br>
You continue inland, [[following behind|Spaniards Meet Marina]] the native messengers.<br>

<<case "Aguilar">>
A day after you first hear the conversation above, you are approached by the Mayan lord who has been your master these long years. He tells you that a pair of messengers have arrived from the coast, bearing beautiful gifts. A group of strangers have come who desire your release and they have paid him handsomely. Your master informs you that you are free and hands you a letter. It reads: <br>
<br>
“Gentlemen and brothers, here in Cozumel I have learnt that you are captives in the hands of a Cacique, and I pray you that you come here to Cozumel at once, and for this purpose I have sent a ship with soldiers, in case you have need of them, and a ransom to be paid to those Indians with whom you are living. The ship will wait eight days for you. Come in all haste, and you will be welcomed and protected. I am here at this Island with five hundred soldiers and eleven ships, in which I go on, please God, to a town called Tabasco or Potonchan.”<br>
<br>
You are elated at the message and set out in search of your former companion, Gonzalo Guerrero. Together, you were the sole survivors of the wreck that left you here among the Maya, but unlike you, Guerrero has adopted this new land and forsaken his one true God. Unlike you, Guerrero has not lived out these long years as a slave.<br>
<br>
When you find him, you share the letter. Guerrero reads it and, much to your dismay, he refuses to leave. “Brother Aguilar,” he says to you, “I am married and have three children and the Indians look on me as a Cacique and captain in wartime,--You go and God be with you, but I have my face tattooed and my ears pierced, what would the Spaniards say should they see me in this guise?”<br>
<br>
You inform Guerrero that God will never forgive him and [[head off to meet your compatriots|Spaniards Quest Instructions 2]].<br>

<<case "Marina">>
For weeks now, the Chontal leaders have been hearing rumors that a group of foreigners has been traveling along the coast, making their way towards your village. When word arrived that they had landed upon your shores, the local chiefs sent an army to head them off. Much to everyone's surprise, many of the men came back wounded, telling stories of their defeat.<br>
<br>
The last few days have seen a flurry of activity in the village. The Chontal leaders have been gathering food and jewelry to offer the strangers in a show of peace and friendship. Their greatest offering, however, will be a group of twenty women. These will not be the sisters or the daughters of powerful families, offered in marriage to secure alliances; instead they will be slave women, with whom the foreigners might do what they choose. The master of your house has informed you that you will be included in the offering and you are sent to join the others.<br>
<br>
When you are brought before the foreigners, one of the men performs a ceremony, speaking strange words that you cannot understand and sprinkling water over your head. He points at you while repeating the word “Marina” over and over. You understand that this is [[what they will call you|Spaniards Quest Instructions 2]].<br>
<br>
<<case "Cortes">>
It's been many weeks since you left Cuba and the island now seems a distant memory. You landed upon the shores of a new land and have been traveling along the coast ever since, meeting different people along the way. Among your many encounters, two stand out.<br>
<br>
The first occurred early in your journey when you landed upon an island and were approached by the residents, who greeted you with a cry that sounded distinctly like “Castilan, Castilan!” You questioned the local people, who shared a rumor that there were Spaniards living as slaves two days journey inland. You listened to this news with great curiosity, but a storm was coming and you hurried on your way.<br>
<br>
Further along the coast, you did battle with a fierce group of warriors who you came to know as the Chontal Maya. The battle was bloody, but it was decided in the end by your cavalry. The warriors gazed in terror at your horses, clearly overwhelmed and confused at a creature they had never before seen. As part of their peace offering, they presented you with twenty slave women. You were told that one of them possesses many skills, including the gift of language.<br>

1:30-2:00		Visit the Armory<br>
2:00-2:30		Tour the Aviary/Zoo<br>

Your first task is to go to your game documents and read Bernal Diaz' account of Tenochtitlán, where you will find a description of each of the five sites above. When you have finished reading, go to your site and start a new page titled “Lonely Planet Guide: Tenochtitlán.” Each Spanish player will be responsible for writing the entry for one stop on the itinerary above.

Your compatriot Bernal Diaz later recalled the sight as such:<br>

<i>“The next morning we reached the broad high road of Iztapalapan, whence we for the first time beheld the numbers of towns and villages built in the lake, and the still greater number of large townships on the mainland, with the level causeway which ran in a straight line into Mexico. Our astonishment was indeed raised to the highest pitch, and we could not help remarking to each other, that all these buildings resembled the fairy castles we read of in Amadis de Gaul; so high, majestic, and splendid did the temples, towers, and houses of the town, all built of massive stone and lime, rise up out of the midst of the lake. Indeed, many of our men believed what they saw was a mere dream. And the reader must not feel surprised at the manner in which I have expressed myself, for it is impossible to speak coolly of things which we had never seen nor heard of, nor even could have dreamt of, beforehand.” (Lockhart, 219)</i><br>

After a long stay in Tlaxcala, where you recovered from battle and enjoyed the hospitality of your new allies, you set out for the Mexica capital of Tenochtitlán. Your forces took a hit in the long and hard-fought battle with Tlaxcala, and you now number only 250--only half the number who set sail from Cuba! However, you have succeeded in building a massive army of indigenous allies. You march onward with a force of 10,000 men. <br>
<br>
Before you enter the capital, you have one important stop to make: the city of Cholula, where you will stock up on some much-needed supplies. You have been assured that this stop is necessary, but it might not be easy. Until recently, the people of Cholula were allies of your Tlaxcalan friends, but now the city's leadership is loyal to the Mexica. There is clearly bad blood between the two peoples and you stay on guard as you approach the city.<br>

It's getting late and you decide to set up camp for the night. Given your wariness towards the people of Cholula, you would rather approach the city by daylight.<br>

You killed many of their men in battle and there are only 250 of them left, but they are skilled warriors and--even more important--they carry powerful weapons. They also bring with them an army of allies and Mexica enemies that they have gathered along the way. With the addition of your men, you are now 10,000 strong. You leave Tlaxcala headed for the city of Tenochtitlán.<br>

You must make one stop along the way, however: the city of Cholula. The people of Cholula were your loyal allies for many years, until they betrayed you to become loyal vassals of the Mexica. There is bad blood between you and you long to make the cowardly Cholulans pay for their betrayal.<br>

As you approach the city, your blood boils, but you remain calm and alert. It's getting dark and your Spanish allies decide to stop for the night, so you set up camp and lie down upon your reed mat to get some rest.<br>

For weeks now, the Chontal leaders have been hearing rumors that a group of foreigners has been traveling along the coast, making their way towards your village. When word arrived that they had landed upon your shores, the local chiefs sent an army to head them off. Much to everyone's surprise, many of the men came back wounded, telling stories of their defeat. <br>
<br>
They recount the harrowing tale to their leaders, telling of dirty men with pale skin and unkempt hair. The warriors surrounded the strangers and quickly overwhelmed them, firing their arrows and piercing them with spears. They were sure they had killed at least two strangers. They were sure they had secured a victory, only to be shocked by the most terrifying sights. First, there was the loudest noise they had ever heard, so loud it left the men deaf and disoriented. The noise was immediately followed by a giant stone that flew through the air, raining fire down upon them. Second, a team of men descended on them, riding upon the backs of the biggest deer they had ever seen! Wounded and terrified, the warriors fled, but not everyone made it out. Over two hundred men fell dead in the battle.<br>
<br>
Never before have you felt such fear among the Chontal people. As they consider their next move, [[you wonder what these events might mean for you|Marina Tells Her Story]].<br>

These strangers might be strong, but Tlaxcala has never been conquered and never will be! They may have defeated the Mexica, but they spilled much blood in the fight. Now is the time to attack!<br>

The battle is long and hard fought. Though you have caught your enemy off guard, they have powerful weapons and put up a valiant fight. You watch as some of your best warriors are cut down by their heavy blades.<br>

After much debate, you decide that the best course of action is to attack the foreigners. You would rather live with the enemy you know. You quietly begin preparing for war, telling your friends that you have yet to make a decision. Meanwhile, you continue playing the gracious hosts. <br>

You saw the Tlaxcalan leaders' eyes light up at the possibility and yet they have been debating amongst themselves for many days. Perhaps their decision is not as easy as you had hoped. You wonder if they might be plotting an attack of their own.<br>

Weeks have passed when your hosts launch a surprise attack! Your hunch was right! Luckily for you, you were not caught entirely off guard.
