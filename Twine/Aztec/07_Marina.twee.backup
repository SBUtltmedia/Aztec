:: Marina Tells Her Story [Done Breaks] {"position":"1375,975","size":"100,100"}
The village is in a state of chaos and you hear that the Chontal elders have been trying to decide what they should do about these powerful foreigners. It is clear to everyone that they cannot risk losing hundreds more men in battle and there is little doubt that, even if the strange men leave, they will return again in the future. Not only would the Chontal people be vulnerable to the strangers, but the devastating losses would also weaken them in the face of their traditional enemies. The chiefs send a messenger to offer peace. <br>

<<else>>

You have been living as a slave among the Chontal Maya for many years now, but you have never forgotten your past life. Born into a noble Nahua family, you were taught many valuable lessons and were respected in your community for your wit and intelligence even at a young age. Among the many things you have acquired in your years as a slave is a facility with the Mayan language, so different from the Nahuatl with which you were raised.<br>
<br>
Today, like every other day, you rose before the sun to begin your chores. As you set to work grinding your corn, however, you find a crack in your metate and set off for the market to purchase a new one. While you were in the market, you overheard a conversation between a local merchant and a trader from Yucatan. Here is what they said:<br>
<br>
<b>Trader:</b><i> Yaan ba'atelil lu'um le witso'obo'. U páajtalil táan u k'éexel yéetel ku beta'al túumben bix u bisikuba'ob.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Merchant:</b><i> Máakalmáak u jaajil le ba'atelil</i><br>
<br>
<b>Trader:</b><i> U kaajil Cholula, otrora etail Tlaxcala, Bejla'e' u jach etail le mexicas.Tlaxcala chokoj Ba'ale' xan ti' teme ti' u páajtalil mexica.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Merchant:</b><i> Le mexicas ku ku k'a'ankach yéetel Amal ujo'. Séeb Tlaxcala yaan k'áate' kaajo' paach le kaambalil yo'osal azteca.Le asab u yetailo'ob Cholulan le ku xu'ulsik.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Trader:</b><i> Le mexicas ken tijik u k'aab Amal ka'atéen asab lu'um. Séeb u comerán le lu'umo' yéetel in lu'um xan. K'a'abet wáaj k je'ela'.</i><br>
<br>
Once you have figured out what they said, you may continue. But [[make note of this information, because it could be important later on|Spaniards Quest Instructions 1]].<br>

You would rather go it alone than subject yourself to the whims and desires of such brutish men. You worry about what might come next, but you are confident that your wits have gotten you this far.<br>

<br>
<<else>>
Are you back in the library? No, you hear the snoring of the other men nearby.  You shift, wondering what woke you.  You experience a moment of brief panic, and then you realize that it is Marina, lying next to you.<br>
<br>
You can't believe your luck!<br>
<br>
Morning comes too soon, and you reluctantly pack up camp to [[continue your journey|On the way to Puebla]].<br>

:: Marina's Choice [Done] {"position":"1975,2825","size":"100,100"}
<<liveblock>>
You wake to the sound of snoring and open your eyes to find you are back at camp. You feel the hard ground beneath you and look up at the stars. You've never seen a night so clear. The horses rest nearby and the men sleep in the open, scattered around the site. As you lay in the dark, you reflect upon the events that have brought you here and you ponder your situation...Marina's that is.<br>
<br>
So far, you've made smart decisions. Your language skills have made you invaluable to these foreigners and you are already starting to understand their strange tongue. Once you can communicate with them directly, your worth will only increase. Not only have they made it clear how important you are to the team, they have each indicated their...personal appreciation of you...some more aggressively than others. Though their affections are worrisome, and even outright frightening, you wonder if this might work to your advantage. Would it be to your benefit to form a relationship with one of these men? If so, which one? Or are you better off fending for yourself? <br>
<br>
You lie awake for hours, weighing this question carefully. Shortly before the sun rises, you make your choice:<br>
