:: Aztecs meet Spaniards and Tlaxcalans on the causeway to Tenochtitlán {"position":"4050,6050","size":"100,100"}
<<liveblock>>
Causeway leading into Tenochtitlán, November 8th, 1519

The Spaniards' journey is finally done and with their Tlaxcalan companions at their side, they descend upon the city of Tenochtitlán. As the city comes into view, Cortes and his men can barely believe their eyes. Situated in the middle of Lake Texcoco, Tenochtitlán is a marvel of engineering, connected to the lake's shores by a series of causeways. As the Spaniards approach, they see an enormous temple rising up from the middle of the city. 
 

An Aztec delegation comes out to meet them. Among them is none other than the Emperor Moctezuma himself. Though he is barefoot, Moctezuma is richly dressed and escorted by his brother, Cuitlahuac, and his Prime Minister, Tlacaelel the Younger. Cortes dismounts his horse and approaches the Emperor to embrace him, sparking horror among the Aztecs, who prevent Cortes from laying hands upon their leader.
 

A ritual then unfolds, with each of the Aztecs bowing to kiss the ground. Each then greets Cortes in turn. When he reaches Moctezuma, Cortes presents the Emperor with a necklace of pearls and glass beads. Moctezuma, in turn, places two necklaces adorned with golden shrimp around the neck of Cortes. 
 

All three factions mingle on the causeway, getting to know each other and formulating their next move. Use this opportunity to get a sense of the opposing side. What do you think they are planning? Who do you trust?

Tenochtitlán, November 1519
 

Together, the Aztecs, the Spaniards and the Tlaxcalans enter the city of Tenochtitlán. The streets are lined with curious Aztec citizens, watching as the strangers pass. Moctezuma takes the strangers into his palace and makes them comfortable as his guests.
 

Later, the Aztecs take the Spaniards and Tlaxcalans out, showing them the wonders of the city. Years later, Bernal Diaz would recall everything that they saw and experienced in those first days in Tenochtitlán.

Spaniards and Tlaxcalans, based on everything you've just read, what would you like to ask the Aztecs? Go to the main discussion board, where each of you must post at least one question to your hosts.
Aztecs, you must respond to all questions in order to advance to the next stage of the game. This must be complete by 11:59 pm DAY 14.
Remember, your journey is far from over, and this is a rare opportunity for everybody to gather information about the other factions. What you ask--or answer--now could make all the difference between life or death, glory or sacrifice, later.

You take him to the roof of the palace and demand that he bring a stop to the assault. <<print $Aztec_Leader>> steps to the edge of the roof and the volley of rocks and arrows comes to a halt.

A mob has quickly gathered and filled the streets, eager to take revenge for your actions in the plaza. You make your way to the palace and barricade yourselves inside. The mob assaults the palace with a flurry of stones, arrows, and javelins, but your men are able to fend them off. You are safe, for now.<br>
<br>
As you consider your next move, <<print $Span_Leader>> suggests that your first step should be to deal with <<print $Aztec_Leader>>, who is currently somewhere in the plaza, surely plotting his revenge. <<print $Span_Leader>> proposes a bold plan: you will take <<print $Aztec_Leader>> prisoner.<br>
<br>
Your men spread out through the palace and succeed in locating <<print $Aztec_Leader>>. You put him in shackles and inform him that he is now your prisoner. If he wants to remain alive, he will do your bidding. <br>

For days, the assault on the palace continues. When it finally stops, so does the supply of food into the palace.<br>

<br>
You make your way towards your private quarters, formulating a plan of escape. You hope they will be occupied fighting off the mob outside, but much to your dismay, they have sent men to track you down and put you in shackles. You find yourself a prisoner to the Spaniards, who inform you that you must now do their bidding if you want to live. What have you done to so displease the Gods? You are the mighty Aztec Emperor! This indignity shall never be forgiven. <br>
<br>
The assault on the palace lasts for days, but the Spaniards are well-armed and defend their position. When it finally stops, the city becomes eerily quiet. Food stops flowing into the palace and it's clear your people are trying to starve out the enemy, and you with them.<br>

The assault continues for days, to no avail. There has been no word from <<print $Aztec_Leader>> since the attack and people fear the worst. Finally, a rumor escapes the palace: word has it that the Spaniards have taken <<print $Aztec_Leader>> hostage. You are dismayed at this news and shocked that a leader so powerful could fall victim so easily.<br>
<br>
The assault on the palace proves futile and the city's nobles convince the people to lay down their arms, for now. You must save your energy for the battle that is soon to come. You begin to prepare the city for battle, building new walls, blocking access to canals, and laying traps. You cut off supplies to the palace, hoping to starve out the enemy and punish this king who has failed you so.<br>

The news in Tlaxcala has left your companions bitter and the mood is dark. The Spanish forces must face the Mexica alone. You heard that the city has been devastated by disease, but will this be enough to assure a Spanish victory?<br>
<br>
As you near Tenochtitlán, you set up camp for the night, preparing to attack by dark. When all is ready, the Spaniards launch their attack, cutting off the causeways and trapping the Mexica inside the city. It seems the Mexica were prepared, however, and you did not have the element of surprise! Even worse: Tlaxcalan soldiers fight at their side! This is not the battle you had prepared for.<br>
<br>
The battle is like nothing you could have imagined. The stakes are high and this will be a fight to the death for both sides. The residents of the city-young, old, man, woman-all join the fray, luring the Spaniards into traps and fighting with makeshift weapons. Many others, however, fall victim to the foreigners' superior weapons. The scene descends into mayhem, but it soon becomes clear [[which side will win|A Rude Awakening in the Library]].<br>

You leave Tlaxcala in ruins and start your journey back to Tenochtilán. You have no choice but to return alone. As you near the city, you set up camp for the night, preparing to attack by dark. When all is ready, the Spaniards launch their attack, cutting off the causeways and trapping the Mexica inside the city. Despite being caught off guard, the Mexica mount a powerful defense. The people of the city spent weeks preparing for just such a battle, and they are quick to jump into action.<br>

The battle is like nothing you could have imagined. The stakes are high and this will be a fight to the death for both sides. The residents of the city-young, old, man, woman-all join the fray, luring the Spaniards into traps and fighting with makeshift weapons.

<b> Your Team Leader is: <<print $Aztec_Leader>></b><br>
<br>	
Mexica, over the last 200 years, you have vanquished your enemies one by one to become the most powerful city-state in central Mexico. Your first leader, Acamapichtli, was a son of the Culhua, descended from the Toltecs. This lineage secured his political legitimacy, and with him that of the empire. Religious legitimacy has been harder to come by, however, for it must be granted by the god Quetzalcoatl and the priests who wield his power.<br>
<br>
Many moons ago, during the time of the 4th sun, Quetzalcoatl walked the Earth and ruled over the sacred city of Tollan. Jealous of his power, Quetzalcoatl's brother, Tezcatlipoca, disguised himself as a sorcerer and tricked Quetzalcoatl into drunkenly cavorting with his sister, the priestess Quetzalpetlatl. The next day, Quetzalcoatl left Tollan in shame, never to return. Quetzalcoatl died in exile, whereupon he was cremated and his remains mixed with the blood of four sacrificed children to symbolize his heart. The heart was then placed in a wooden box and locked in one of the many temples that dot the landscape of central Mexico. The priests who guard this temple hold great power and only they can grant <<link "the blessing that you seek" "Quest: Aztec Instructions">><<th-set '$Aztecs_currentMap' to 2>><</link>>.<br>

You will find the heart of Quetzalcoatl in the city of Cholula. You must travel there to claim the heart and secure his blessing. Your journey will be long and difficult, however, and you will need many resources to sustain you if you are to succeed. Collecting these resources is the key to victory. <<print $Aztec_Leader>> clearly has great confidence in you.  He has chosen you to lead your team in this quest.<br>
<br>
Do not hesitate in this journey, for you are not the only ones seeking this treasure. Your sworn enemies, the Tlaxcalans, have fought valiantly against you for many years and have resisted conquest. They would deny you the blessing of Quetzalcoatl to claim it for themselves, a feat which would surely fuel their warriors and steel them in their struggle against you.<br>
<br>
When you have read the following instructions and are ready to begin your quest, click the link below to enter the palace. <br>
<br>
In the palace you will find 6 place glyphs. Each of these glyphs represents a site of great significance in Central Mexico and in each you will find a vital resource for your journey. In order to collect each resource, you must work with your team to identify the correct name that corresponds with the glyph. Click on each glyph to visit that place and receive a clue to its location. You will need to draw on all your knowledge to solve each puzzle! Once you have figured out where you are, you will enter the name into a text box that is only available to you. When you enter the correct response, your entire team will advance to collect the resource located there and you will not be able to return.<br>
<br>
When you have obtained enough resources to survive your journey, you will be allowed to travel to Cholula. Because the Aztecs have further to travel, they must gather 5 goods, while the Tlaxcalans only require 4. <br>
