:: Introduction to your assigned faction [Coding-Problem] {"position":"3875,1125","size":"100,100"}
<<liveblock>>
Welcome to the Spanish Aztec War! 
<<th-set '$charCreated' to "true">>
You are part of the <<print $users[$role]["faction"]>>

Let me tell you a bit about your people: 
<<switch $users[$role]["faction"]>>
<<case "Aztecs" >>
 You are the mighty Aztec Empire! You are conquerors of central Mexico, who have claimed vast stretches of territory and stricken fear into the hearts of your enemies--the delicious hearts of your enemies! It is now spring of 1519, and you've received word that a group of strange men have landed on your shores. Reports indicate that these men do not come from neighboring states that remain to be conquered, but have instead arrived from the sea, traveling on small islands made of wood. They bring with them giant deer, like nothing seen before, and a group of Mayan slaves. You are curious about these visitors and send a delegation to investigate. What is their purpose here? 
 
<<case "Spaniards">>
You are bold and noble Spaniards! You have set forth into the unknown to claim new lands for the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, and new converts to the Catholic faith. It is spring of 1519, and you have made your way up the coast of what appears to be an enormous landmass, into unknown territory. You have unfurled your flag, loudly proclaimed the requerimiento for all to hear, and have succeeded in establishing communication with the natives. And what they have said draws your attention. They tell you of a great city that lies to the west, a city full of gold and countless wonders. You can barely contain your excitement. And yet, there's one small problem: the King has only granted his permission to explore the coast and not to venture inland. You already left Cuba against the orders of the Governor, Diego Velazquez, who revoked his own permission shortly before you left. Will you risk violating the orders of the crown to pursue what may be little more than a rumor?

<<case "Tlaxcalans">>
 You are indomitable Tlaxcalan warriors! For generations, you have fought back against the Aztecs and maintained your independence. It is now spring of 1519, and you've received word that a group of strange men have landed on the shores to the east. Reports indicate that these men arrived from the sea, traveling on small islands made of wood. They bring with them giant deer, like nothing seen before, and a group of Mayan slaves. It is clear that they are no friends of yours, but are they friends of your enemies? When you hear that they plan to advance towards the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán, you prepare yourself for battle, as it seems likely they will cross through your territory--a territory you have defended valiantly until now.

A ship full of bearded men has been seen off the coast of Tulum. <br>

After eight years, you thought this day would never come! You can barely contain your excitement as you prepare for your escape.<br>
<br>
Translation: <br>
<b>Yich'ak-k'ak':</b> <i>Yesterday, I was in the park where I met a man from Tulum. A few days ago, he was looking out to sea and saw a big house appear in the water. The house came closer and closer and the men of the city gathered to see the house. When the house got close they could see that it was full of men with pale skin and lots of hair. Tulum's men didn't know where this house came from, but they saw trouble. They made noise and fired rocks into the sea. The house turned back and disappeared.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Chak-balam:</b> <i>Did they see the house another time? Do they know where it came from?</i><br>
<br>
<b>Yich'ak-k'ak':</b> <i>No. It is strange. I think we should keep watch.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Chak-balam:</b> <i>Our men will go to the water to wait. If the house arrives on our water we will make them leave.</i><br>

<<case "Spaniards">>
With the events of Cholula behind you, you now enter the mountain pass at the foot of a great volcano. Your guides tell you the name of this fiery mountain, Popocatépetl, and warn you of its danger. You watch smoke billow overhead as you make your way through the treacherous pass, at the head of any army 10,000 men strong. You will soon reach your destination and lay eyes on the great city of which you have heard so much.<br>
<br>
Your journey has been complicated so far, and it makes you think about what lies ahead. How do you feel heading down into the Valley of Mexico? How do you feel about your allies the Tlaxcalans? <br>
<br>
Go to the Spanish discussion board and share your thoughts with your companions. <br>
<br>
When you are ready, you bed down for the night. Your guides tell you that you are close to the city and you wonder if this will be the last time you <<link "make camp before your arrival" "Waking up in the library 3">><<th-set '$Spaniards_currentMap' to 0>><</link>>. <br>

<<case "Tlaxcalans">>
With the events of Cholula behind you, you now enter the pass at the foot of the great fire mountain, Popocatépetl. You share tales of the mountain with your Spanish friends, who gaze in awe at the clouds of smoke that billow overhead. Tenochtitlán waits on the other side of the mountain and you will soon reach your destination, leading an army of 10,000 men.<br>
<br>
You've thrown your lot in with the Spaniards, or have you? How have the events that unfolded at Cholula impacted your relationship with the Spaniards? Who holds the upper hand in this alliance you've made?<br>
<br>
Go to the Tlaxcalan discussion board and share your thoughts with your companions.<br>
<br>
When you are ready, you bed down for the night. You are close to the city and this may be the last time you <<link "make camp before your arrival" "Waking up in the library 3">><<th-set '$Tlaxcalans_currentMap' to 0>><</link>>. <br>

<br>
This army is nothing compared to your own, which is the most powerful force in all of history. Tlaxcala is a tiny city state compared to your massive empire and the foreigners are few in number. And yet, the events that have occurred so far may give you pause. How do you feel about their arrival? Is there any reason for concern?<br>

The time has come for you to make your escape. As you gather your final supplies, you thank God for the spy who kept you informed about the Mexica's many preparations for battle. You know that only one causeway to the mainland remains and that parts have been destroyed, leaving it impassible. When you learned this, your men gathered wood and built a portable bridge, which you now take with you. <br>
<br>
As quietly as any army that has gone before, you make your way out of the palace through the eerie darkness towards the last remaining causeway. It is all for naught, however! You have been spotted and you watch the lake that surrounds you fill with canoes. Mexica warriors descend upon you from all sides! As you approach the first break in the causeway, your men put down the portable bridge and you are able to cross, but others are not so lucky. The bridge collapses under the weight of so many men and you carry bits of wood in a feeble attempt to cross the next break in the causeway. Chaos surrounds you as men and horses plummet into the depths of Lake Texcoco.<br>

<<else>>
The time has come for you to make your escape. As you gather your final supplies, you thank God for the spy who kept you informed about the Mexica's many preparations for battle. You know that only one causeway to the mainland remains and that parts have been destroyed, leaving it impassible. When you learned this, your men gathered wood and built a portable bridge, which you now take with you. <br>
<br>
As quietly as any army that has gone before, you make your way out of the palace through the eerie darkness towards the last remaining causeway. It is all for naught, however! You have been spotted and you watch the lake that surrounds you fill with canoes. Mexica warriors descend upon you from all sides! As you approach the first break in the causeway, your men put down the portable bridge and you are able to cross, but others are not so lucky. The bridge collapses under the weight of so many men and you carry bits of wood in a feeble attempt to cross the next break in the causeway. Chaos surrounds you as men and horses plummet into the depths of Lake Texcoco.<br>

<br>
<</if>>

<<case "Aztecs">>
The whole city flies into action and you watch the chaos that unfolds before you. It seems there have been spies in your midst, for the strangers carry with them a makeshift bridge. Many moons ago, the residents of the city cut off all but one causeway that connects your island city to the shore. This last remaining causeway was itself made unpassable by long broken stretches, but the Spaniards are prepared. You see them lay down their sad little bridge at the first break in the causeway, only to be shot down by the warriors that have flooded into the lake in their canoes.<br>
<br>
As you run into the fray, cutting down your enemies, you watch as men and horses plummet into the depths of Lake Texcoco. Blinded by the chaos of war, you are vaguely aware that some of the Spaniards have made it down the causeway. Out of the corner of your eye, you watch them scramble to shore, but you must fight where you are and cannot give chase.<br>
<br>
When the battle is finally done, you survey the scene before you. You wonder how many escaped with their lives. Given the carnage that surrounds you, it cannot have been many. Weary from battle, you thank the gods for your life and [[hope that this tragic chapter is finally done|Spaniards Decide How to Proceed]].<br>
<br>

<<case "Tlaxcalans">>
It has been many moons since you left Tenochtitlán, grateful to return to your own lands, your own people. Nonetheless, you have kept close watch on events from afar, aided by an extensive network of spies.<br>
<br>
On this morning, you receive a shocking report. It seems the Spaniards attempted to flee the city... and paid an enormous price. According to your spies, the dead far outnumber the living, who have been spotted in the mountains high above the city. <br>
<br>
You wonder if they will [[eventually make their way back to Tlaxcala|Spaniards Decide How to Proceed]].<br>

<<print $Span_Leader>>, you have heard rumors and rumblings amongst your faction that they are planning a mutiny. You don't know whether or not this is true, but you are fearful for your life and must not let them rob you of the glory that lies ahead. As you move to the group discussion board on the next screen, you must ensure that the entire faction is ready to follow you inland in pursuit of your dreams.<br>
<br>
You weigh your options and decide that the best course of action is the boldest: retreat cannot be an option! You will beach the ships so that your crew has no choice but to forge onward. Though not destroyed, fixing the ships would require many weeks of repair, assuming they could even find the necessary materials. <br>
<br>
Proceed to the next page, where you will learn [[if there is mutiny|Burning the Ships]]. Your decisions thus far have impacted your scores. Consider where you stand with your men as you decide how to proceed.<br>

As the smell of blood and smoke fills your nostrils, you wake with a start. You jolt upright, open your eyes, and let out a scream. You are back in the library, but this time you're not alone. The room is lit with a soft, red glow and looming over you is the most terrifying figure you've ever seen. <br>
<br>
A walking skeleton stands eight feet tall. Feathers sticky with blood cling to his bones and he bears the stench of death. You thought this whole adventure was just a dream, but the god of the Aztec underworld now stands before you. You briefly wonder if you are still dreaming, but when a drop of blood falls on your hand, the feeling is all too real. You know you are awake.<br>
<br>
As Mictlantecuhtli begins to speak, smoke spills from his open mouth. “Human, you have come to my lair uninvited one too many times. Every time I want to nap, I find you in my chair. Robbed of sleep, I have completed all your assignments for you in the hope that you would go away and never come back. And yet, here you are. Again. Have you no gratitude?”<br>
<br>
“And so, I will make you an offer: I will continue to do your work and you will make the Dean's list every semester for the rest of your college career. What you do with that success is up to you. All I ask is for two things in return: first, you must stay out of my chair and second, you must promise me your immortal soul. When you finally reach the end of your life, you will join me in Mictlán. If you refuse me this offer, you must leave immediately and promise never to return. Worst of all, you must do your own damn work. The choice is yours.”<br>
<br>
Well, this explains a lot. You knew you couldn't have written those papers--they were just too good--but you had no idea the price of plagiarism was so high! You think about all the assignments that still await you; graduation is a long way off. Is all that work worth the price of your eternal soul?<br>
<br>
You rise up out of the chair, knees shaking. You know what you must do...<br>

You sent a pair of indigenous messengers out ahead to announce your arrival and declare your good intentions, but they failed to return. Though you would prefer to have assurances that you will be met peacefully, you have no choice but to forge on.<br>
<br>
A day into your journey, you encounter the messengers upon the road, both of them in a state of terror. They tell you that they were imprisoned in Tlaxcala and only managed to escape because the Tlaxcalans were preoccupied preparing for your arrival. The messengers claimed that the Tlaxcalans had threatened them, saying: “Now we are going to kill those whom you call Teules, and eat their flesh, and we will see whether they are as valiant as you announce; and we shall eat your flesh too, you who come here with treasons and lies from that traitor Montezuma!” The messengers tried their best to convince the Tlaxcalans that you share an enemy in Moctezuma, but could not change their minds.<br>
<br>
Alert to the danger ahead, you steel yourselves for battle and thank God for his favor in sending you this news. You send your horsemen out ahead and they are able to thwart an ambush. The battle that follows is fierce and bloody, lasting many days. 45 of your men are killed on the battlefield, but your preparations serve you well and you are able to secure [[a narrow victory|Spaniards defeat the Tlaxcalans in battle]].<br>
<br>
<<case "Tlaxcalans">>
Your first communication with the foreigners comes in the form of two messengers who they send to meet you. The men inform you that the strangers are approaching your territory, but assure you that they seek no quarrel. They claim that you share a common enemy in the Mexica Emperor, Moctezuma, but you do not trust them and you take the two messengers prisoner. <br>
<br>
After all this time wondering what might come next, you now know that the strange men are headed your way. You begin preparing for war, leaving a crew of men to defend the homefront while the bulk of your forces advance ahead to prepare an ambush. <br>
<br>
The foreigners surround you, however, almost as though they knew what to expect! You've lost the element of surprise and a bloody battle ensues. It lasts many days and you kill many of their men, but their weapons are too much for you and you are overwhelmed by the giant deer that they ride into battle. Despite your best efforts, the foreigners prove to be too much and you are eventually [[forced to retreat|Tlaxcalans lose battle to Spaniards and decide whether to form an alliance]].<br>

You carefully weigh the Spaniards' offer. This may be your best chance to do away with your Mexica enemies for good. At the same time, you question the Spaniards' loyalty and wonder if they are, in fact, the greater danger. This decision is not to be taken lightly.<br>

<<case "Spaniards">>
You sent a pair of indigenous messengers out ahead to announce your arrival and declare your good intentions, but they failed to return. You take their disappearance as a bad sign and wonder if they met their fate at the hands of the Tlaxcalans. You have no choice but to forge on.<br>
<br>
You make your way quietly through the woods when one of the men sees movement up ahead. You're being watched and you glimpse the man's bow and arrow as he darts across your path. Already on edge, one of your men aims carelessly into the woods with his crossbow, launching an attack. The man fires back and an arrow whizzes past your head!<br>
<br>
Your horsemen run ahead and they encounter a group of Tlaxcalan soldiers, preparing for what appears to be an ambush. The battle that follows is fierce and bloody, lasting many days. 45 of your men are killed on the battlefield, but your preparations serve you well and you are able to [[secure a narrow victory|Spaniards defeat the Tlaxcalans in battle]].<br>
<br>
<<case "Tlaxcalans">>
Your first communication with the foreigners comes in the form of two messengers who they send to meet you. The men inform you that the strangers are approaching your territory, but assure you that they seek no quarrel. They claim that you share a common enemy in the Mexica Emperor, Moctezuma. After all this time wondering what might come next, you now know that the foreigners are headed your way. You send the messengers back with your reply: you will welcome them in peace.<br>
<br>
You prepare for the arrival of these strange visitors and take a delegation out to meet them. One of your guards runs out ahead when he is attacked! He rushes back to the group to warn you and you quickly prepare for battle. A thunderous sound bears down upon you and soon you are confronted by a herd of giant deer! The strangers sit perched atop them and they rush upon you, tearing at you with knives! <br>
<br>
A bloody battle ensues. It lasts many days and you kill many of their men, but their weapons are too much for you and you are overwhelmed by the giant deer that they ride into battle. Despite your best efforts, the foreigners prove to be too much and you are eventually [[forced to retreat|Tlaxcalans lose battle to Spaniards and decide whether to form an alliance]]. <br>

Fifth, the waters of Lake Texcoco set fire, boiling and bubbling, destroying houses along the shore.<br>

Sixth, at night, a woman could  be heard crying out, “O my children, we are about to go forever.” “O my children, where am I to take you?”<br>

As you lay down your arms, you see the others do the same. Is it real? Can this really end in peace? You can hardly believe your eyes, but it seems peace has come to Tenochtitlán.

You waken and take a deep breath, trying to calm your racing heart before you open your eyes. This is the moment you've been waiting for. You must know how the story ends! Slowly you open your eyes and see before you...the library. <br>
<br>
No! This can't be right! You need to get back to Tenochtitlán! You close your eyes, desperate to fall asleep and return, but to no avail. You lean back in the chair, willing it to happen.<br>
<br>
It's only when you finally give up and accept defeat that you notice something alarming: there's no door. Panicked, you pound on the wall with your fists, yelling at the top of your lungs for anyone to hear, but no one does. Then you remember that this is the 21st century and you grab your phone to call for help, but the battery is dead.<br>
<br>
You pick up your assignment and wonder how much time you have until it's due. You don't even know what time it is. The ancient clock on the wall says it's 3:45, but is it even right? And is it the middle of the afternoon or the middle of the night? Will you ever get out of here? You collapse into the chair as the clock ticks loudly at your back. Tick...tick...tick...<br>
